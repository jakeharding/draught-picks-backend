Organic American two-row and English Maris Otter malts lay the foundation, while a generous dose of English roasted barley, black malt and chocolate malt create layers of roasty, dark complexity.

Fermentation was completed in stainless and racked to a 1,000 gallon Foeder (large oak barrel) for aging. After being on the wood for two months, we added 200 pounds of fresh peaches and allowed it to age another 12 months before packaging it for you.

Brewed in the spirit of the abbey ales of Belgium, (512) THREE pours a deep golden with a dense, creamy white head. The authentic Belgian yeast strain produces a complex, spicy palate that balances ripe fruity esters with bready malts and firm but subtle hops.

For the first ever bottling, only one 200L barrel was bottled.

47	27aaca5a-de14-41bc-bde7-0f107e62bb36	(512) Wild Bear	(512)’s first excursion into the world of so-called wild fermentation, Wild Bear’s origins lie in our Fall seasonal, BRUIN. After primary fermentation, we added Brettanomyces yeast and Pediococcus bacteria cultures, and aged the blend in new oak barrels for over 10 months. This combination of wild “bugs” and barrel aging gives (512) Wild Bear a complex and enticing aroma of tart cherries, oak, and a touch of barnyard “funkiness”, a crisp, tart flavor that will intensify with age, and an effervescent, oaky finish that leaves the palate clean. More recent versions are aged in one of our 45HL Foeder for 24 months.	8.5	9	XnPVIo	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:47.984079-06

This beer is a re-imagination and reinvention of our much fabled, award winning, Colonial Pale Ale. Buckets of Centennial, Cascade, Saphir, El Dorado and Fuggle went into this beer, a celebration of the hop growing prowess of the Sacramento region. This beer is aromatic and deeply hoppy without being to bitter; massive late hop additions created a mass of green goo on the floor of our kettle and a beer that wallops you from a mile away with its intense hop aroma. Its nose is so full of deep earthy spice notes, with overtones of pear and fresh stone fruit that it leaves a sillage of aroma as you hold your pint.	5.2	35	EPnv3B	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:47.989279-06

It is a mildly hoppy pale ale using a 2 row pale base malt and several other specialty malts for body, color, and head retention.

65	e7d1e0f0-de68-4954-bb49-2cd1b2345ea5	"Admiral" Stache	Milwaukee Brewing Co’s take on a classic European style. Baltic Porters are the stronger lager fermented cousin of the classic London Porter. The higher strength and cold fermentation help to create a smooth, less fruity porter, rich in roasted malt flavors and aromas. The “Admiral” Stache has a deep brown hue with a light caramel head. Toffee and milk chocolate dominate the flavor with subtle hints of dried fruit. One month of aging in Bourbon Barrels imparted a layer of vanilla and oak.\r\n\r\nWe first developed this beer in 2007. Our first attempted batch of beer at the 2nd street location was a Baltic Porter. What we ended up with became known as “Shake Down Nut Brown”. You can guess what went wrong from there… But, so many things right! Every year that has gone by, the beer has gotten a little bit stronger, in flavor and alcohol.\r\n\r\nWe use a black malt for the dark rich color and an extra special malt for the dried fruit flavors. Baltic Porters are fermented cold with a lager yeast. That long slow maturation creates a smooth flavor profile. The anticipation of the bourbon barrel aging it the most exciting part of this brew process. We want that oak character with hints of bourbon, we use 3rd run barrels for this result. Each batch has been slightly different from the last.	7.0	23	tmEthz	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:48.104362-06

125	c959392e-3ff3-4bac-8d80-94f6c1f072d0	1554	Born of a flood and centuries-old Belgian text, 1554 Enlightened Black Ale uses a lager yeast strain and dark chocolaty malts to redefine what dark beer can be. In 1997, a Fort Collins flood destroyed the original recipe our researcher, Phil Benstein, found in the library. So Phil and brewmaster, Peter Bouckaert, traveled to Belgium to retrieve this unique style lost to the ages. Their first challenge was deciphering antiquated script and outdated units of measurement, but trial and error (and many months of in-house sampling) culminated in 1554, a highly quaffable dark beer with a moderate body and mouthfeel.	5.6	21	YBW4h3	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:49.545159-06

This strong, malt-forward brew smells of caramel apples, has a surprisingly light body, and has the flavor of freshly cut melon along with some toffee.	8.4	30	q4ToLY	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:49.547875-06

Lacking any historically documented recipes, our brewers developed the 1634 Ale using malted barley, malted wheat, malted rye, molasses and caraway; ingredients known to be available to brewers in the austere conditions of early Colonial Maryland.	5.5	\N	VfUm4r	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:49.566552-06

The recipe consists of 7 malts, one of which Kevin toasted personally in his toaster oven, just like the old days, and 5 different styles of hops. In true SweetWater style, there is no style, but it’s big, bold, and meant to grow old, meaning this beer will be fantastic out of the gate, or you can lay her down in the cellar for many years to come.	\N	\N	xwYSL2	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:49.549129-06

Typical of the style, it is very cellarable. The final product is a blend using beer that was aged in Bourbon barrels, some from aged maple syrup Bourbon barrels and some from standard fermentation. After blending, the beer was allowed to mature in bottles and kegs for a few months before releasing.	15.0	\N	oVesmK	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:49.553811-06
133	e0d1a3bb-a83b-4558-9a65-f03452e292d6	15th Anniversary Escondidian Imperial Black IPA	In the 15 years since we entered the craft brewing world, change has come not in a straight line, but as an exponential curve. The craft brewing movement has long been called a "revolution." But today the air is so thick with revolution, it's palpable. No longer is it only an awareness among the faithful; the unconverted are beginning to feel it as well. Denial and ignorance are disappearing in favor of opened eyes, curiosity and the sense that there's something larger out there. For far too long we have been lied to. For far too long we have been oppressed by the notion that dumbed-down lowest-common-denominator mediocrity was all that we could, and should, expect. You might think we're talking only about the world of brewing, but we're not. There is a myriad of products out there masquerading as cheeses, coffee, chocolates, breads...hell, there is stuff pretending to be "food" that our great-grandmothers would not recognize as such. Yet the craft brewing movement, together with the artisanal food movement, is making much progress. Where the industrial companies can't dismiss or bury us, they are attempting to copy us with cheap facsimiles. Yes, chances are if you are holding this bottle, you understand these things to be true about the world of brewing. You also likely understand the importance of our fight at Stone against accepted "norms" over the last 15 years. We believed that America was ready to embrace things made with artistry and passion. You have spoken. Your response has been clear. We are not merely consumers to be spoon-fed whatever commodities need to be unloaded for a profit. We have only just begun to move the needle of this revolution, and mediocrity still reigns. Consider that when you reject dumbed down, industrialized food and drink, you also support craft brewing. The line is nearly seamless; we are fighting the same battle. We will not win in our lifetime, as the powers are too entrenched, and the masses too fooled. And shackled. However, this is a revolution of ideas and of taste, and we will win. How do you want to be viewed by your children, and your children's children? As a hero, or as the oppressed? (Those that don't think they have been oppressed are already lost.) Ultimately, it's up to you to decide. We hope you'll stand with us. Strong and unyielding. You are needed. This bottle and its glorious contents are a celebration of you, brothers and sisters, and your importance in this fight. Cheers to all we've accomplished together in the past 15 years, and cheers to the adventure ahead!	10.8	100	msDlpp	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:49.554862-06

139	bd47e00f-329a-4cfe-95ab-d0371b74e684	1600 Kölsch	FSB’s take on a classic German style beer brewed in honor of the 1600 Group, the community-minded neighbors who united to buy the building that would become Fifth Street Brewpub. They helped make all this possible. It is widely accepted among beer aficionados that the Kölsch was Germany’s answer to the English pale ale. The subtle effervescent fruitiness and mild hop bitterness hovers happily on the palette, and pairs perfectly with fish and light dinners, but just like an IPA or Pilsner, it holds up well with grilled meats and sandwiches. The crisp clean finish makes 1600 Kölsch a naturally great session beer. 1600 Kölsch is incredibly flavorful, and at 5.0% ABV, it’s almost impossible to drink just one.	5.0	\N	HwXClu	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:49.561053-06

This beer is brewed to a dark copper shade and and well balanced malt and hop with distinctive toasted flavors from both our premium specialty roasted and chocolate malted barley, also allowing for a faint undertone of caramel. This style is lightly hopped for balance and this ale will prove to be a wonderful selection for a sessionable beer.

216	03c2f0fa-0637-496e-b1c9-0fe099d0d60e	2010 Blunderbuss Barleywine	Barleywines are generally the strongest style of ale, with an alcohol content to rival most wines. In fact, it is this high alcohol content coupled with extensive aging which contributes to the very complex nature of our Blunderbuss. A beverage such as this is meant to be savored and appreciated much like a fine brandy or cognac, or, in the world of wine, a fortified sherry or vintage port. (But a barleywine is all beer!)\r\nThe process of creating our barleywine began by cramming our mash tun to overflowing with American and Scottish pale malts. We then extracted only the richest first runnings from the mash and boiled extensively to further concentrate the sugars in the wort. During the boil a touch of honey was added to the kettle, along with six varieties of hops to provide balance for the sweet malt. Fermented in stainless it was then sent to the CBC Barrel Cellar where it aged in a quintet of Buffalo Trace rye barrels (previously used for aging a strong beer named Utopias, brewed by our neighbors in J.P.).\r\nThe result is well worth this painstaking ordeal. A creamy, pale tan head rests atop this beautiful, hazy golden liquid. Captured within the rim of a snifter, the first aromas to greet the nose are of alcohol’s fruity esters, then rich caramel, and sweet malt. As it warms, more distinguishable notes of burnt sugar and toffee, vanilla, coconut and oak are detectable. The flavor more than meets the prelude of aromas. Its rich, full body contains notes of sweet caramel, tart flavors of berries and dried fruit, and a subtle herbal hoppiness. This is finished by warming alcohol and a lingering finish with hints of vanilla, coconut, toasted marshmallow and oak. This ultimate after-dinner drink pairs well with many desserts, but is also certainly a dessert in and of itself.\r\nCHEERS!	12.8	\N	NqlLfj	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:50.362482-06

It is a big white ale brewed and infused with a variety of spices. At 8.5% ABV and relatively dry the light spice blend including nutmeg, hazelnut, black cardamom, cinnamon, and bitter orange peel comes through nicely but is not over powering. We apply the same principles we do every year with this beer. Brew something different from the year before that is lightly spiced to complement the grain bill. Brewed with pilsner malts and white wheat the beer is golden in color with a slight haze.\r\n\r\nGood news is even though Santa is no longer with us, we generally get something for the holidays anyway…	8.5	29	v9dNdF	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:50.371189-06

Holiday parties often have warm concoctions of spices and booze at the ready to knock the ice off of toes while raising spirits. We were inspired by a “Glögg” party, deciding on the spot to brew a beer that pays tribute to this Nordic tradition.\r\n\r\n2xMas Ale combines traditional brewing ingredients with figs, orange peels, cardamom, cinnamon, clove and ginger root. It’s a holiday addition to the 2X line and another reason to toast to the season, but unlike Glögg, we recom- mend serving this one chilled.	8.0	\N	qK1MvT	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:50.79709-06

Even simplified to one variety of hop and one type of malt, it is amazing how complex the flavor is. In a way it is a lot like looking into a kaleidoscope, where the simplest object suddenly becomes a transfixing multitude of images, repeating and reflecting until a whole is realized, only to watch it change yet again.	8.1	\N	c7WT9s	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:50.798376-06
236	05b5abcd-4d27-42c8-a92a-e7a58bfa4947	2Xpresso	Espresso is a drink that is not for the faint of heart. Pulling a perfect shot is as much a science as it is an art form. Come to think of it, the same can be said for brewing beer. Of course, both coffee and beer have certain, shall we say, ‘uplifting’ qualities. To combine the two is a natural progression. Our 2xStout is considered by many to be a perfect milk stout. We started with that in mind, and added espresso beans and lemon peels for a true Italian style pick-me-up. The result is a stout so black, so rich, and so creamy, it’d be at home in a café served with biscotti. Yet, it’s beer.	7.5	55	n65icZ	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:50.799681-06

Even simplified to one variety of hop and one type of malt, it is amazing how complex the flavor is. Mosaic hops are known for their luxurious tropical citrus notes like passionfruit and work absolutely brilliantly with the richness of Special Pale malt.

239	4ad0f1e5-cf03-48a2-a8e9-aaaee5aff54e	2XStout	Milk stout, also called ‘cream’ or ‘sweet’ stout, is a stout containing lactose, a sugar derived from milk. Because lactose is unfermentable by beer yeast, it adds sweetness and body to the finished beer. Milk stouts have been claimed to be nutritious, and were marketed as such in the early 1900s with claims that would make the FDA wince. One ad read, “Ideal for nursing mothers, for the healthy, for the invalid, and for the worker.” Surely! \r\n\r\nOf course, we couldn’t stop at a traditional milk stout. Ours is a double, an addition to our 2X line, and at 7.5% abv is every bit as delicious as it sounds. To your health!	7.5	50	R0MvCF	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:50.80332-06

This tasty winter warmer started life as a small batch beer brewed for the Al Johnson Uphill Downhill a telemark ski race in Crested Butte, Colorado. The Uphill Downhill celebrates the exploits of Al Johnson, letter carrier extraordinaire, who delivered mail by ski in the late 1800 s. Dry hopping during fermentation creates a floral nose with a hint of pepper and spicy, subtle undertones. 2° Below provides a bright, hoppy palate and a cheery warm afterglow.	6.6	32	6KeVJA	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:50.804506-06

Using a world famous UK floor malted barley as a base, 3 Bolt Pale is a genuine craft beer. Classic old world bittering hops impart a spice-defined palate with floral characters, whilst the late kettle, new world aroma hops result in a pleasant citrus and pine needle nose that segues into stonefruit. A clean finish consistent with its top fermenting yeast culture, 3 Bolt Pale is a flavoursome craft ale, best drunk young and preferably in the presence of the brewer!	4.5	35	dGbmuu	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:50.814983-06

Hop bitterness, aromas and flavors are not readily perceived but provide back stage structure to balance the roast malts and oak tannins.  The pleasant, medium body, gentle warming and dry finish of this opaque/black imperial stout perfectly suits it for a snifter on a cold, midwestern night.	11.6	82	YP4dCI	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:51.060324-06

Brewed once in 2009 and perhaps never again.\r\n\r\nThe idea for this brew came from owner Ben Cook's original attempts at crafting the Orange Wheat beer as a homebrewer. The first attempt came out with way too much alcohol, but after an extended aging tasted great.

317	8d618f32-dfca-478a-807a-2e83ede66fb5	6288 Stout	Introduced in 2007, the 6288 Stout is our winter season specialty beer. It is a rather lengthy process to brew the 6288 Stout. It is brewed with 5 different malted barleys, using American and French hops. Keeping with the Tuckerman tradition, it is cold-conditioned, dry-hopped and bottle conditioned using the krausening process. The fermentation takes about two weeks, twice the time of our other beers and conditioning takes three months! It’s worth the wait, as the extra time gives this special brew time to mellow, offering a very smooth dark, malty flavor.\r\n\r\nThe 6288 Stout is named for the elevation of New England’s tallest peak, Mount Washington. Tuckerman Brewing Co. is a supporter of the Mount Washington Observatory and donates a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Stout to the Observatory’s weather and science exploration. The Stout made Beer Advocate’s list of top stouts.	6.3	\N	Edu7My	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:51.584457-06

418	d21b4966-cc98-4aea-ae64-9704d56e9e26	30th Anniversary	Nearly 300 years ago, 100 families left Belgium for a new life in Louisiana, settling near New Orleans. Their ship, La Loire, is sometimes called the Louisiana Mayflower. This Belgian-style IPA is a tribute to those settlers. Made with pale, pilsner, and wheat malts, it is hopped and dry hopped with German Hallertau Blanc hops for a pleasant bitterness and the aroma of grapes and fruit. Belgian yeast adds to the fruity aroma. \r\n\r\n30 years ago Abita Brewing launched the craft beer revolution in Louisiana. For three decades, Abita has proudly brewed full-flavored ales and lagers for the way we love to live in Louisiana.	7.0	65	VvA9kl	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:52.176521-06

Jack agreed to guest brew this very special ale with us in honor of our 30th anniversary. This Black Barleywine Ale is a nod to the legendary ales New Albion served at their legendary summer solstice parties.

408	99fd46ed-45bd-48ae-aa6c-c3184e6c285c	20th Anniversary Citracado IPA	For 20 years our passion for brewing and our obsession with hops have challenged traditional styles and expectations for beer. So it’s only fitting we commemorate this momentous occasion by crafting a liquid ode to bold brewing that satisfies your hop thirst and pays homage to our flagship San Diego brewery, located on Citracado Parkway (which itself pays homage to the citrus and avocado agricultural history of the region). \r\n\r\n“Citracado” also teases the two key ingredients of this beer. “Citra” refers both to the juicy gem of a hop and its citrusy (and tropical) aromas and flavors. “Cado” inspired us to utilize wonderful, native avocado flower honey. Combine the two and the result pours like silk and abounds with enough hops to match our excitement for reaching this 20-year milestone. We thank you sincerely for the years of support and pledge that we will, as always, strive to live up to the reasons for your loyalty!	9.0	80	mttNd0	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:52.168537-06

The barleywine takes inspiration from our classic Extra Pale Ale recipe, adopting the same essential profile while taking flavor and character to even greater heights. This beer was brewed using ingredients from four of Summit's major suppliers. At 11.5% ABV it is sure to lend warmth to the coldest winter’s night.	11.5	50	dlZBx4	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:52.182831-06

This medium-bodied, floral ale features the unique flavor attributes associated with Maris Otter, perhaps the most famous heritage malting barley available to brewers today.

This is the most geographically accurate location of the finest food, music and round-the-clock good times on earth. Abita created 30° 90° to celebrate the way we love to live in New Orleans.

Then, in 2011, we DOUBLED the spicing to take the taste of this amber colored, medium-bodied German-style lager to a new level of flavor. The resulting variant of “31” indulges your senses with its smooth, malty palate, moderate 5.7% abv, and double helping of fall spices for a refreshingly intense finish of cinnamon and nutmeg that makes Double Spiced “31” all treat and no tricks.	5.7	27	9eyUBt	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:52.186977-06
432	f3c7206a-4612-476f-8826-2b7b60001436	31 Heroes	In August 2011, a helicopter carrying a group of military service members  – many of them Navy SEALs – was downed in Afghanistan. The tragedy is considered the largest single day loss of American lives in the history of Special Operation Forces.\r\nThe 30 service members (call sign ‘Extortion 17’) plus one military K9 have come to be known as the ’31 Heroes.’ We were approached by some of the local family members of the 31 Heroes about brewing a beer in their honor. Our wheat IPA was made to commemorate these fallen heroes on the date of the fifth anniversary of the crash. A portion of the proceeds of this beer, at the taproom release and in distribution, will go to The Special Operations Warrior Foundation, which provides college scholarships and educational counseling to the surviving children of Special Operations personnel killed in the line of duty.	6.9	\N	WeF2nK	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:52.187811-06
433	5beea172-e0c8-4141-b3f6-42d200de7667	31 Kings	This IPA is set apart from others by the beer's powerful aroma that is flowery and herbal with hints of lemon and notes of passion fruit. 31 Kings has a balance of slight caramel malty sweetness that combines with an intense yet rolling bitterness profile. This also sets our IPA apart from others which focus on a punch in the face of hops rather than a harmony of bitterness and flavor. Finally, flavors of pine and orange trickle into the aftertaste allowing a clean and refreshing finish.	6.5	75	UQBWDD	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:52.188582-06
434	fb0e8ee2-7532-42bf-9ade-2bcafcd4d425	311 Amber Ale	Held to the light, this Amber Ale shines brilliantly and hints at the solid malt backbone.  The nose is filled with scents of citrus, and tropical fruits which emerge from the wonderful use of Equinox hops.  Buried beneath these initial aromatics is the suggestion of the blend of malts which combine to set this Amber apart.  The flavors lead with a slightly elevated bitterness which then flow into the medium bodied mesh of malted barleys.  Sessionable and assertive.	5.5	25	A3ym1i	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:52.189324-06

An amalgam of styles, we like to call it a Belgian-Black-Triple-Rye-India-Pale-Ale. Candied orange and minty hops come through in the nose, with a hint of warm spice and caraway. The flavor is toffee-like malt with a touch of roast, and a medium bitterness to play off of the fresh-baked rye bread peppery notes.

The beer is meant to be a little bitter, but not over the top and very drinkable. The hop aroma and flavor do not dominate the beer, but support the malt to create a well balanced beer.	5.6	37	oEUHmS	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:52.205361-06

They didn't make dunkel-style dark lagers like this one, but the roasted malts and caramel make us think of old bohemia.	5.2	22	rzkzCS	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:52.207192-06

Upon tasting, the hops are still on the front, and they are balanced with the malty, toffee like flavors contributed from the blend of crystal and amber malts used in the brewhouse. The finish is deliciously bitter, with a touch of warmth provided by the 9.5% alcohol. Bitterness comes in at 90+ IBU.	9.5	90	todpTX	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:52.210754-06

A few weeks later we tried the creation with trepidation… and it was fantastic! Years have passed and we’ve grown to become much better brewers, and this stout has grown better with us. Mixing a complex malt base, a healthy dose of maple syrup and an unusual blend of hops, this beer, just like our state, is truly an original.	6.4	38	ex4jAG	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:52.212237-06

This beer here is to ease the burden of heroes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Brewed with Herkules and Medusa hops, the 13th Task Golden IPA is Dangerous Man and Fulton's fight against the titans of beer. The ancient world was filled with pedigree, and this ale stands proud in it's lineage with Herkules derived from the German Hallertau Taurus. Medusa hops are a beast made from older gods and is a hop variety entirely different from anything derived from Europe. Soft fruit tones, including melon, peach, and mango, row in stead with the simple beat of the malt's drum. A golden demigod of a beer with a Gorgon's smile. Enjoy with a ferocity.	6.6	53	TW67DY	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:52.212986-06

And a particularly prominent hop aroma in smell and antrunk.\r\n \r\nIt has a very intense hops aroma, which is achieved by a double cold hop ("Hopfenstopfen") with Hallertauer tradition, Hersbrucker Cascade, Hersbrucker Mandarina Bavaria hops and USA Chinnok at different times of the long maturation of the beer.\r\nWithout the citrus components in the aroma of the Cascade hops, the triumphal procession of the American "craft brewer scene" could hardly be imagined.\r\n \r\nThe powerful, but round bitter, is ensured by a generous gift from Hallertauer pearl aromas during the wort boiling.\r\n \r\nThe name "736" is based on the first written mentions of hop cultivation in Hallertau in 736 AD.	7.5	\N	UqbscY	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:52.262625-06

This year we will be using Heidelberg Pilsner Malt, instead 2-row for the base malt. We will also be using flaked oats for body. The beer will be dry hopped with Kent Goldings and Mosaic, but the hops for the boil are still to be determined.

Puréed tangerines were added to the batch to create a devastatingly fresh IPA with a tang of tangerine. The orangey, tangerine flavors yielded by this addition to the recipe meld beautifully with the bitterness of the hops. True to this series, Stone Enjoy By Tangerine IPA is brewed specifically NOT to last, and should be enjoyed within 37 days.	9.4	90	b0mE6Y	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:53.429317-06

Inspired by the west coast IPAs we love, we added a thump of hops to a dynamic malt profile and chose a yeast to drive these two further than they wanted to go. Throw our water into this mix and you will find dank green resinous hops popping over orange, mango and papaya aromas, with just enough sweetness of body to make the long finish a pleasure to have around. A double IPA perfect for adding fuel to the fire of a dinner, a game, or an idea, drink it when your night matters. (Available only in NJ)	7.8	80	btwcy1	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:53.431761-06

Wells\r\n\r\nLike an early morning summer ride through the Indiana countryside, this American wheat ale is golden and hazy with earthy pine and tropical fruit notes rippling throughout each sip.

The ale was so good and the response to it so overwhelmingly positive that it has become the crown jewel of REEL ALEs.\r\n\r\nTen different hops: Horizon, Chinook, Columbus, Willamette, Tradition, Northern Brewer, Santiam, Tettnanger, Cascade and Golding, in the order of their use -- give Ten Squared a unique hop character which has to be tasted to be believed.\r\n\r\nEven with 100 IBUs, this brew sports a strong malt backbone. Two-row Pale, Caramel 40, Caramel 75, Special B and Aromatic malts impart remarkable balance for such a hop monster. This is smooth ale with surprising similarities to ten year old malt whiskey.	10.0	100	Ml1FV3	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:53.462926-06

Named in honor of the 7th Street wharf across the street from the brewery, this filtered wheat ale is light-bodied American style with pounds of fresh lemon basil added after fermentation.  The light citrus taste with a hint of spicy herb on the back goes well with almost any seafood dish, and from what we hear, is a favorite at bars as a stand alone refreshing beer.	4.5	\N	YNP1P7	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:53.633445-06

A big chunk of Rye is used to give the beer a spicy, earthiness, mashed up with Cara malts to create a rich, bold mouthfeel. Zesty Southern hemisphere and american hops are used in abundance to balance the residual sweet malt character. Masses of dry hops are piled after fermentation to spike a wild blend of tropical, spicy aromas.	6.2	65	Jra85l	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:53.636971-06

It is basically our Scottish Ale’s little sister. This ale is lower in alcohol than the Scottish Ale. To give this beer caramel flavor, Our Brewmaster took a portion of the first runnings of wort and transferred it to the kettle.The Brewmaster then boiled these runnings for an hour to caramelize and reduce the wort. This gave the beer a nice caramel flavor. Scottish breweries list their products in ascending order of gravity and strength as Light, Heavy, Export                                  and Strong. In the past, beer in Scotland was taxed based on strength, so the                                      beers became known by their tax ratings: 60 shilling, 70 shilling, 80 shilling, 90                                    shilling.

690	5dd50edd-0682-4276-847b-95ca11ac8c7e	8140 Black IPA	8140 ain’t our altitude folks so don’t go telling our friends at Mammoth Brewing Company they aren’t the highest brewery in California. The 8140 Black IPA was brewed in homage to the eight thousand one hundred and forty square feet of sheet rock we had to hang in our brewery.  As the ring leaders of the monumental task we naturally asked our supreme friends Jonathan Widen and Dave Thomas from Premier Painting Plus what kind of beer they wanted and naturally they said BLACK. So before you sits a Black IPA with an ingredient list as ominous as the color (basically it has more ingredients than will fit on the page). So enjoy the black hoppy goodness and avoid hanging drywall at all costs!	\N	\N	uGjng3	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:53.681712-06

The milk stout, also known as sweet stout, breakfast stout, cream stout (all the same style) gets its name mostly from the addition of lactose, which is an unfermentable sugar derived from milk. Because this type of sugar is unfermentable, its smooth mellow sweetness stays in the beer. This beer is a sweeter style stout, which includes some chocolate and coffee like roasted barley flavors. Very smooth and creamy with low-medium bitterness and balanced hop flavor and aroma.	6.0	29	6sF5dv	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:53.750946-06

With over two months of fermentation and cellaring time, this saison plows the field as it harvests spicy farmhouse overtones from its primary Fraunch saison yeast. That funky monkey delivers a strapping alc 9 % by vol, seeding a perfect foundation for secondary Brettanomyces fermentation, which hoes a cornucopia of tart and effervescent flavors.

We found mashing the base malt at a higher temperature created the perfect balance. We then hopped in with everything under the sun and found our favorite combination came from using predominantly European noble hops that balanced the spiciness from the rye malt and the sweetness from the mashing technique, to make an easy drinking pale ale.	6.0	\N	cG6leo	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:53.761141-06

713	b5d3de06-e391-4921-82c9-e194cd856768	1811 Lager	Two centuries ago, on the site of what is now the Fort George Brewery block, fur magnate John Jacob Astor’s expedition boldly built a trading post they called Astoria—the first US settlement west of the Rocky Mountains. Today, we’re proud to craft the Official Bicentennial Beer of Astoria.\r\n Many West Coast brewers in the 19th century had no ice, so they improvised an effervescent beer by brewing lager yeasts at higher-than-normal temperatures. Described as a “refreshing drink, much consumed by the laboring classes,” it’s the inspiration for 1811 lager.\r\n\r\nMore flavorful than most modern lagers, and fermented at warmer temperatures, 1811 is lovingly concocted from 2 row malted barley and cracked maize; corn was a popular beer ingredient in pre-Prohibition days. 1811’s hop character gives it a distinctive Northwest style worthy of Astoria’s 200-year history.	5.1	\N	9XmyZr	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:53.773774-06

A complex, mild spice accentuates a light fruity-ester aroma while the overall hop aroma  remains low.  The use of pale malts result in  brisk malty palate containing a hint of sweetness in the center, but with a light dry finish. Hop bitterness is medium and tends to equalize the balance of malt.

It called and provided for one great state university in each state of the Union and inadvertently led to tailgate parties, marching bands, fight songs and Bowl Games. Ohio took advantage in 1870, building a fine university right here in Columbus.\r\n\r\nAs Justin Morrill proposed to put a degree in the people’s right hand, the Land-Grant Brewing Company seeks to put a quality beer in the left. Our 1862 Ale, a German-style Kölsch, is a crisp and easy-drinking beer, especially perfect for when that big rival from the north comes to town.	4.9	33	XdLHAW	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:53.796762-06

And for those of you taking notes, it’s the higher finishing gravity that brings a classic toffee and caramel sweetness…which all great Scottish ales are famous for. So while we think our version is worth 85 shillings, we won’t charge a shilling over 80. Honest.	5.0	\N	8thdED	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:56.281597-06

Honey has always been considered to be the best remedy from hang-over due to high content of fructose.\r\n\r\nThe taste and aroma of honey fully dissolves in the malty drink leaving no traces, but at the same time it specifically influences upon taste sensors. It is this that allows experiencing the taste anew, familiar so long ago, incredibly flavorful and rich.\r\n\r\nEnjoy a new design of familiar taste!	\N	\N	YScod5	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:56.826169-06

African Amber’s pioneering and innovative style is proof that drink-abilty does not have to be achieved by sacrificing flavor. This beer erupts with a floral, hoppy taste, followed by a well rounded malty middle, finishing with a nicely organic hop flavor. Locally sourced two row grain and a blend of specialty malts give our amber its rich taste. Further complexity is achieved by leaving the beer unfiltered, providing exceptional flavor, as well as giving our amber its unique "cloudy" look. Lastly, we actually place a bag of fresh, locally grown, Yakima valley hops in each keg creating what has become the original, cult classic, northwest amber ale.	\N	\N	mRnPQU	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:56.845723-06

1002	8b37db5b-b8d6-4ce6-baee-eb700e7d7d0a	Abbot Ale	Abbot Ale is brewed in Bury St. Edmunds – a place which enjoys a rich brewing heritage than can be traced back almost 1000 years.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe famous Domesday Book includes a passage about 'cerevisiarii' or ale brewers as servants of the Abbot in Bury St Edmunds' Great Abbey. The Greene King brewery sits alongside the historic ruins of the Abbey and to this day our brewers still draw water from the same chalk wells used by their brewing predecessors all those years ago.\r\nHailed by the late beer writer Michael Jackson as "one of the great characters of the beer world", Abbot Ale is brewed for quality of the highest order. Abbot is an irresistible ale with masses of fruit characters, a malty richness and superb hop balance. It is brewed longer to a unique recipe, which makes it the full-flavoured, smooth and mature beer it is today.	5.0	\N	WNdNIc	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:57.228831-06

Unlike most soft drink manufacturers, Abita sweetens its root beer with pure Louisiana cane sugar. The resulting taste is reminiscent of soft drinks made in the 1940s and 1950s, before bottlers turned to corn sugar and fructose. Some soft drink makers add caffeine to their product, but Abita is naturally caffeine-free.\r\n\r\nAdd a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an old-fashioned root beer float. Abita Root Beer can also be used in cooking to create delicious glazes and sauces as well as cakes and other desserts, or you can keep it simple – just pour it into a frosty mug and slurp loudly through a straw.	\N	\N	rlErBn	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:57.904385-06

After fermentation and storage, the beer is mechanically purified in a centrifuge. Even when served very cold, it may be slightly cloudy. In this way, Floreffe Blonde maintains its inimitable bouquet and aromas. The drinker first breaths in the malt and fruity aromas. The bitterness comes from a subtle mix of the best hop varieties. The first sip is powerful but is transformed into a taste of softness and ends with a finale of liquorice root.	6.5	\N	Tjy40I	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:58.088137-06

A great beer that perfectly suits cheeses with a hard crust or some fine Bries and Camemberts.\r\n\r\nThe aftertaste has a noble bitterness.	7.0	\N	jFLgkw	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:58.094583-06

Light head that remains for an average time.\r\n\r\nNose: First a dairy and cheese-like aroma. Then, coffee and roasted coffee beans. A touch of warm brown sugar,\r\ncane sugar and rum.\r\n\r\nIn the mouth: The mouth closely follows the nose, the roasted coffee, the grill. The caramel is just right without being too much. Then there is a lovely freshness that balances the whole but attention this is a beer for with a meal or for tasting. Goes well with meat with sweet and sour sauce, duck à l'orange ....	8.0	\N	4UcPMq	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:58.095428-06

When Jeff and Kim first sampled the beer at the Lyons Folks Fest, reviews were mixed at best. One of founder Jeff's first two Belgian style homebrews (along with Fat Tire), Abbey is a Belgian dubbel (or double) brewed with six different malts and an authentic Belgian yeast strain. Abbey is bottle-conditioned, weighs in at 7.0% alcohol by volume, and pairs well with chocolate (or boldly served by itself) for dessert.	7.0	20	4CFzKV	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:58.100229-06

Our first ever beer, with which we opened the doors in 1997, and still one of our two bests sellers. Deep burgundy color, rich and malty, with aromas of anise, fresh apricot, chocolate and honey, topped by a dense tan head. Rich on the palate but with a dry finish. Develops wonderful caramel, fig, and currant notes with age. Enjoy Ommegang Abbey Ale with savory dishes, slow-cooked pork, marinated roasts, barbeque, rich cheeses, and almost every dessert. Ommegang Abbey Ale has been recognized many times, most recently with a gold medal at the 2010 World Beer Cup.	8.2	20	jYBtXz	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:58.107878-06

We brewed a pilot batch with this hop exclusively and one with it blended with some of our other favorite Northwest varieties. In the end, we decided that the El Dorado had such a unique and interesting character on its own, so we decided to brew it as a “single hop” pale ale. The aroma and flavor offer intense candied orange and citrus zest. A touch of flaked oats provide a rounded, silky mouthfeel. And like our other hoppy offerings, tiny was brewed to finish dry and clean.	5.5	\N	bVoltA	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:58.116901-06

1135	62fa0d02-c0f3-4a80-bab8-a436d8f4c8f4	A-Town Brown	Red Brick Brown Ale is the beer that launched our brewing legacy in 1993. It was inspired by the malty brews of England, but we gave it an American sized attitude. Deep copper gives way to an off-white head when poured into a glass, offering aromas of sweet malt, caramel, and almond. Our Brown Ale is surprisingly light bodied, which plays well with the sweet caramel, fresh pecan, and bread notes you discover on each sip. Brown Ale is a great beer to enjoy outdoors on a clear autumn afternoon.	6.5	16	oGO96g	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:58.130597-06

The story of this beer dates back to January 2006 when for the first time came into contact with the character so new and irresistible American hops. However I realized right away that in Pale Ale of my dreams I wanted to express something that goes far beyond this, since the construction of a complex bouquet, charming and never usual was my challenge. For this Travelling between England and Germany, visiting hop growers and experiencing very distant varieties (New Zealand) I conducted a search in the olfactory area of hops that perhaps will never be totally finished (without prejudice to the unmistakable character of A.F.O. that will always remain this). A beer that I always coveted: dedicated to the obsessed of Ales like me.	5.4	\N	ItwXfJ	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:58.135225-06

This is a tawny colored brew that was a favorite among the farmers and laborers of the West Midlands.  The alcohol content is 3.9% abv.

1171	f08156fe-50ef-4ee4-bd0d-3b5e085df7d7	25th Anniversary Vanilla Double Dog	Turbodog® is the inspiration for this robust dark ale. Double Dog is brewed with generous amounts of pale, caramel, and chocolate malts and Willamette hops. Whole, natural vanilla beans are added during the aging process. This combination provides a rich body and color with chocolate, vanilla and toffee-like flavor.\r\n\r\n25 years ago the Abita Brewing Company was founded on a pristine, artesian aquifer north of New Orleans.

1146	5e6fb8a7-5b2a-48d4-830c-e33b7db56262	A.P.A	Blackstone A.P.A. was a collaborative effort between Blackstone brewmaster Dave Miller, brewmaster Harry Klausner and co-founder Kent Taylor. Kent’s sons Charles and Adam also had a major role in the development of this beer.  (O.G. 1.049    IBUs 33)\r\n\r\nAmerican pale ales are fashioned after the pale ales of England but with distinctly different hop character. The use of American hops, particularly Cascade, lend citrusy grapefruit character to the beer. American hops also have a very floral aroma.\r\n\r\nTasting notes:\r\nAppearance: Clear copper color with a white head.\r\nAroma: Floral citrusy hop aroma\r\nTaste: Citrus and resinous pine balanced by toasted, bready malts. Good amount of bittering, but certainly not over the top; strong dry hop character.\r\nMouth feel: Medium body and good mouth feel that holds to the end\r\nFinish: Noticeably bitter finish\r\nOverall: This is an aggressively hopped beer; a hop heads dream while providing enough malt to not disappoint.	5.3	33	rBuo01	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:58.138896-06

1164	0fa68923-8198-4f7d-9fe0-544d0185741d	25th Anniversary Apricot Ale	The second volume of our Anniversary Series is this Belgian-style apricot ale. Pours a golden-orange color from the apricot purée with a fine, off-white head.  The apricot-forward nose, followed by spice and malt, gives way to mild pear and melon esters followed by a biscuity malt aroma. The fruit melds well with the malty sweetness, like apricot preserves on a fresh baked biscuit, while earthy and spicy U.S. Saaz hops balance the sweet entry. Apricot, malt, and spicy hop flavors all linger, a refreshing crowd pleaser on a summer day.	6.0	\N	mLp0XX	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:58.897192-06

When the smoke cleared we threw some Citra, Simcoe, Mosaic, Galaxy, Columbus and Sorachi Ace into the kettle and developed a Double India Pale Lager for our 25th Anniversary.\r\n\r\nThis big, bold boom box in a bottle brings the beat and delivers a hip-shaking hoppiness that dances around the palate.	8.5	75	3uWSpT	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:58.899582-06
1167	8c2ee775-ac38-4488-ab55-ef7a8b037823	25th Anniversary Imperial Pumpkin	The third installment of our Anniversary series beers pays homage to the Brewery’s first few years, and to its Wisconsin roots: Brandy Barrel-Aged Imperial Pumpkin Lager. It pours a copper-orange with a fine, off-white head. The aroma is caramel-forward, followed by cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, oak, and subtle brandy notes. The full, moderately bright mouthfeel starts  with cinnamon, nutmeg, and caramel malt, then yields Madagascar vanilla bean, oak, and brandy flavors. A lingering oak and malty sweetness are left on the palate; a reminder of how we’ve honed our craft over the past 25 years.	8.0	\N	OfXogy	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:58.900616-06

First of four in our series, it pours a deep, dark black with a mocha brown head that gradually retreats to the edges of the glass. A strong chocolate aroma arises, followed by sweet malt and mild tart cherry. The full, dense mouthfeel yields a malty sweetness followed by chocolate, cherry, and vanilla flavors, then finishes with a slight alcohol warmth, leaving roasted malt and chocolate notes until the next sip.	10.0	\N	hnd83I	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:58.901587-06

Our 27th Anniversary Wheatwine is brewed in the Barleywine style, but contains no barley malt, instead, it is mashed and brewed with 100% Wheat Malt. The beer has a rich golden hue and is brewed with Wheat and CaraWheat Malts and hopped with a blend of UK and NW hops. Complex aromas of apricot, spice, and citrus lead to a smooth palate, blended with notes of caramel, marmalade, and green hop overtones. Doesn’t that sound like a great reward for being good or what?

In that spirit, we offer this India Brown Ale in celebration of the season.\r\n\r\nBig'er, Bad'er and Bold'er, the 29'er is the bike (and beer) to go huge on. With 29" wheels instead of the usual 26", this monster bike eats the trail up in chunks. We thought it a suitable name for this slightly more aggressive India Brown Ale. 29'er is a classic brown with a hoppy roasted nose to balance a nutty, strong malt body that finishes with smooth chocolate and coffee undertones. Goes well with the adrenaline rush of bombing down a backcountry trail. Enjoy the ride, friends. Bombs Away!\r\n\r\nMalt: NW Pale Malt, Bonlander Munich, Brown.

This type of beer requires special yeast that provides interesting spicy flavors and aromas. We used fresh-pressed apple cider from Los Rios Apples in Oak Glen and combined it with carmelized sugar made for us by a local culinary school. The combination of yeast, apple and caramel (along with some malt and hops) created unique flavors of clove spice, bready apple pie and a sweet, fruity finish.\r\n\r\nBrewed in the summer of 2010, this beer will be around for a limited time.

We added cooked rice to the fermenter (yes, the fermenter) to try to leach a bunch of the starches and rice character from the rice (we all know that light beers made with rice have no rice character and virtually no character at all). We then used a sake yeast to ferment the beer. After fermenting we threw a kink into the “sake beer” idea and added acai puree to get a nice fruit balance on top of the starchy rice backbone.	\N	\N	Wo6J5B	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:59.069461-06

Once again, the starting point is our white beer made by top fermentation to which mandarin juice and the natural aromas of grapefruit and lime are added. Its cloudy appearance, its natural pink grapefruit colour, its fine slightly pinkish head and its pleasantly fruity fragrance are certainly going to delight the most delicate palates. \r\n\r\nA perfect balance is achieved through the sweet and acid taste of the citrus fruit and the slight bitterness that it releases. It is defined as a very light and refreshing beer. \r\n\r\nYou are advised to drink it very cool. It is ideal after sport! It has barely 3% alcohol volume. The Agrumbocq is currently available in kegs and 25-cl bottles.	3.1	\N	A9TO9x	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:59.102659-06

The intense gold color pairs the rich taste and the full body if this beer. The high IBU (about 70) is well balanced by the sweetness of the malts. British hops were used according to tradition, but in a very peculiar way involving the final hop-back. The beer aged in a wooden vat to give the sensation of the long journeys IPA made to reach India. The final dry-hopping after fermentation added freshness and smoothness.	7.5	\N	XvkGa5	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:59.10342-06

It is brewed with a blend of five American hops, Columbus, Chinook, Cascade, Centenial and Wilamette and Pale Ale malted barley, along with some Munich malt, Crystal malt and malted wheat give a biscuity backbone to the citrus from the hops.\r\n\r\nFergus our Head brewer explains: “America might have started out replicating beer styles from the rest of the world but they have moved far beyond that and now their beer styles are influencing the rest of the world. I think their take on the original English India Pale Ale is the most successful. It’s may be slightly odd to recreate a version of a style that was originally exported from these shores, but I love the smell of hops and an American IPA is a showcase for citrus hops. They are big, bold, some might say brash, but, to my mind at least, beautiful.”	4.8	\N	zM8uBP	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:59.114839-06

It’s a 4.1% abv amber gold beer with a sweet, honeyed, floral aroma. On the palate, it has a slight floral sweetness balanced by biscuity malt and crisp bitterness.”\r\n\r\nBrewed to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012, the recipe for our Diamond Ale is based on last year’s Wedding Ale.

It’s brewed with a blend of Wheat and Pale Ale malts to give a spicy, biscuity undertone to the beer, but it is in the hops where the beer really shines. A blend of hops from England, Slovenia and America (namely Boadicea, Columbus and Stryian Goldings) combine to give a wonderful grapefruit and tropical fruit aroma and bitterness that is balanced by the sweetness of the barley.\r\n\r\nOriginally brewed as a one off to celebrate the opening of our new brewhouse and our new distribution centre, it is now one of our permanent beer. The beer was created under the direction of our Chairman, Jonathan Adnams, whose instruction was to ‘Brew something to wow me’.\r\n\r\nIt came first in its class at the 2008 World beer awards and has also won a Gold medal at the 2008 BBI (British Bottlers Institute) awards.	6.7	\N	ZXTCMB	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:59.127626-06

1298	2caf6a51-de5a-45f7-9d9f-158d6cd5201e	Adnams East Green	A light golden beer with subtle citrus and grassy hop aromas, dry and refreshing, with well-balanced bitterness. Brewed with locally sourced barley, grown and malted in East Anglia and English Boadicea hops.\r\n\r\nEast Green is a pale blonde beer that began life as an effort to produce an environmentally responsible beer that had flavour and integrity in equal balance. We wanted to design a beer that uses a minimum amount of energy without compromising on quality.\r\n\r\nWe use Pale Ale malted barley grown and malted in East Anglia, and Boadicea hops, which are grown in Suffolk’s only commercial hop yard. We chose Boadicea as not only is it available locally but it is also an aphid resistant hop. Aphids, as anyone who has a hop plant growing in their garden will know, love hops, and so aphicides are sprayed during the season. Boadicea is naturally resistant to aphids so this cuts down on the amount of pesticides that have to be used.\r\n\r\nAll that aside, we also think it is a great hop. It has a fantastic grassy lemon quality that works so well with this beer. We use the hops at 3 stages during the brewing process in order to maximise the flavour we get from it.	4.3	\N	4wkwwa	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:59.119012-06

We use two American hops, grown in the Yakima Valley in Washington. These hops, called Columbus and Chinook, add wonderful grapefruit flavours to the beer.	4.3	\N	bhmrLg	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:59.119802-06

1308	a117fd22-1780-4e19-b8c0-de1eda2fd0b9	Adnams Green Bullet	This is a amber beer with a spicy, lemon, grassy aromas which follow through on the palate, good sweetness and mouth-feel from the malt to balance the lemon rind bitterness with a dry finish. Brewed with Pale Ale and Cara Malt and hopped with Green Bullet.\r\n\r\nMost beers are brewed with more than one hop variety, and one or more malt styles, in order to create a wide breadth of flavour and aroma. In beer, we don’t often see a single hop variety used in isolation in this way. However, as in winemaking where wine can be made using a single grape variety, Fergus, together with M&B, thought it would be an interesting, and tasty, idea to try and test the conventions of the beer category by concentrating on one distinctive hop.	4.6	\N	YDeBYK	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:59.126102-06
1309	8ede081a-9c7e-4447-a561-30209daea4a7	Adnams Gunhill	At 4.0% abv, this is a traditional dark ruby beer described as across between a dark mild and a brown ale. We use a blend of 4 different malts to give a rich dark beer that belies its low ABV. The toffee, chocolate and spicy flavours come from the Chocolate, Crystal and Aromatic malted barleys and the sweetness left from the Tipple malted barley is balanced by the bitterness from the Boadicea hops.\r\n\r\nFirst brewed in 2008, this beer was chosen to celebrate one of Southwold’s famous landmarks – the six cannons that face out to sea. It is said these cannons, weighing 18 pounds each, were given to the town in 1746 by the Royal Armouries as a protection to shipping against raids. See them for yourself when you next visit us. The cannons are still fired ( which is quite a spectacle) for special occasions in Southwold.	4.0	\N	xDkOCk	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:59.126929-06

Don’t fall into the third ring by overindulgence. Light in color and body yet big on the Belgian flavor with slight fruity notes and plenty of residual sweetness from the candi sugar added late in the boil.

Our goal with this beer was to pay tribute to what we love about the band – loud, sweaty, raucous, good old American rock and roll that elevates the sounds of the American landscape to make something exciting, new and yet immediately classic.

Their recipe pays tribute to the Pabst Brewing Company’s Ballantine IPA that Jeff first tasted in 1974.  Our favorite description for this beer comes from Beer Advocate:  “It is not polite. Its flavors are almost defiant- a huge nose with hops and malt struggling for control, a bit of oak, just the right carbonation and an insanely long finish worthy of any hop-head.”\r\nIn recognition of their contribution to a crowd-funding campaign at our Ypsilanti Microbrewery location, one of the perks extended to the Rankerts was the opportunity to stop by the brewery and brew the recipe of their choosing.  Fortunately for us, they are nationally acclaimed home-brewers and we think you’ll agree that they knocked it out of the park with this recipe.	7.2	90	9O0r2S	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:46:59.414135-06

Brewers Gabe Fletcher of Midnight Sun Brewing Company [Anchorage, AK] and Colby Chandler of Ballast Point Brewing Company [San Diego, CA] designed and brewed an exciting representation of their passions: hops, Belgian yeast, oak aging and Brettanomyces.\r\n\r\nJust prior to the Great Alaska Beer & Barley Wine Fest in JAN 2009, Gabe and Colby brewed a West Coast-worthy IPA at Midnight Sun Brewing Company. This hop-centric beer became the jumping-off point for other intense flavors. During its course to completion, 3767 was affected by three different yeast strains--including Brettanomyces, aged for several months in French oak Cabernet Sauvignon barrels, and then bottle- and keg-conditioned.\r\n\r\nThe plan is for 3767 to hit Anchorage, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and San Diego in NOV 2009 for a West Coast Toast.

We’ve taken our deceptively drinkable Belgian Tripel and crossed it with a bold American IPA. The result is a smooth, refreshing golden beer with big citrusy flavors of tangerine and grapefruit, subtle complexities of clove, bubble gum, and smarties candies, and a drying finish. Less bitter than most IPAs; more refreshing than most Belgians. Absurdly good. Let it warm to taste the full complexity.	8.4	\N	woexcT	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:00.343575-06

In the true spirit of the project, we have created a beer based on the classic Belgian Abt style, with unique Wisconson contributions including Santiam and Chinook hops. To further highlight the Dairy State we've added lactos foe extra mouthfeel and richness. The result is a dark ale from our use of French and American oak along with spicy hop notes. This ale is designed to drink now, but we believe will evolve beautifully over the next 1-2 years. Enjoy Abtsolution with roasted meats, rich cheese and of course, friends.

1446	43568792-ef48-40ea-9c77-639468955afc	Abzug	In the late 1800s, Vienna brewers made three versions of their amber lagers. The highest alcohol version was called Marzen or Fest Bier. The lowest alcohol version was called Abzug, which means "discount" or "reduction" in German. These beers were the Austrian version of session beers. Our version tips the scales at 3.75% alcohol by volume. It's crisp, refreshing, with a nice floral Saaz hop nose, a malty palate, and a clean finish. This is the beer we brew for the wineries during harvest, but it's available to everyone.	3.8	26	CF32gC	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:00.357328-06

Our Mexican lager is a crisp, clean refreshingly light golden lager that compliments almost any meal.

On the other hand, you are opinionated (we get it), but why be a buzz kill and express disapproval when you can loudly and enthusiastically express approval? Beer drinking is fun, exciting, and often times challenging, so let’s be Pollyannaish about the experience that each new sip provides. This Belgian Golden Strong Ale is brewed with mostly Belgian pilsner malts and a whole bunch of Belgian candi sugar. We then added lots and lots of apricots because apricots are cool and Shakespeare called them an aphrodisiac in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” We’re not sure if that’s true or not, but if you look at them a certain way, they do look like a butt.	7.7	25	Rz9lHw	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:00.366897-06

Doppelbocks are traditionally brewed with Pilsner or Munich malts, but we chose to showcase the awesomeness of Maris Otter and Belgian dark crystal malts.  Result?

1474	1aec1bc3-8839-4116-b102-f878ebf547a8	Alchemy Hour	On the West Coast, surfers have a term for that perfect time of day, when the waves are breaking just right and it feels like you can ride forever. They call it Alchemy Hour. In Cleveland, our surfers have to work a little harder to find a perfect swell. Dressed in wetsuits, up at dawn, they camp out on the shores of Lake Erie in near-freezing temperatures, waiting for the ultimate wave. Crazy? Yes. Extreme? Definitely. Alchemy Hour Double IPA pays tribute to the North Coast’s unlikely surf bums and the ancient quest for liquid gold, wherever it may live: on the ocean, in a lake, in a bottle.\r\n\r\nDistinctively American, the Double IPA or Imperial IPA is thought to have originated in California. This fairly new style is a heartier, hoppier version of the traditional IPA with a higher alcohol content, creating a very strong and flavorful drinking experience	9.4	80	5F7Myv	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:05.397431-06

Belgian yeast contributes spicy esters, while the malty flavors of caramel and toast are the backbone of this beer. It gets really interesting with spicy, citrusy hop aromas escaping the thick, white head, and the high effervescence delivers a surprising bitterness.

1479	1fdc6bca-3c25-4c71-8891-1a9beae3aa7d	Alderaan Ale	Alderaan is a Russian Imperial Oatmeal Stout brewed with Pale Ale malt as the base and a host of wonderful specialty malts such as Roasted Barley, Black, and Dark Crystal from the Thomas Fawcett’s malt house in England.  We also incorporated both flaked oats and oat malt in the mash to impart a rich silky mouthfeel and texture. Alderaan has complex malt flavors and aromas reminiscent of dark baker’s chocolate, fresh brewed coffee, and caramel candy.  Hop additions impart a clean, balanced bitterness and hints of earthy-spiciness dancing around the intense malt backbone. Don’t be fooled by the smooth easy drinking nature of this robust dark ale, it packs quite a punch! This is a very limited offering; the rest of the batch went into bourbon barrels earlier this year and will emerge this fall. Cheers!	9.6	\N	xIUOg0	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:05.402846-06

The aroma blends sweet malts, a hint of chocolate, and a light earthy nose that highlights the malty aromatics. Ale Camino has a round and full-bodied flavor, full of sweet malts, chocolate malts, crystal malts, and hop varieties Willamette and Zythos added for minimal bitterness and aroma, hand-crafted together for a rich, complex flavor and aroma.

1490	a125242c-25fb-4670-9322-8dc00f8bd9d7	Ale Cider	We created a very distinct brew that is a combination of a classic English ale and traditional dry cider. Our unique blend produces a malt forward, dry apple finish. Never sweet, always drinkable, this is what a specialty ale should taste like.\r\n\r\nIt is a truly unique combination that brings the best of two craft worlds together - the crisp and tart apple taste with the best of ale - the color, head and mouth feel.\r\n\r\nChapman's Ale Cider starts with a big helping of malted barley, cracked right here in our brewery. The barley is specifically chosen for the unique way it interacts with the fresh apple cider. Add some hops and the mix creates the wort - this is the amazing liquid that is rich with complex flavors and sugars.\r\n\r\nThe taste you will experience after this process includes a crisp cider smell and feel, slightly dry, and what is left is a complex aftertaste of a classic ale. Combining the rich taste of a cider with the satisfying after effect of an ale.	6.5	8	xs2hOp	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:05.412172-06

Based on an ancient recipe, and using brewing methods long forgotten by most modern brewers, the Hermit defies simple style classification. The beer greets your palate with a solid malt body of sweet caramel, balanced by an assertive hop bitterness. We then round out the flavor using traditional American hop varieties that contribute a beautiful quality of wild flowers and delicate fruit. Those delicious hop flavors mingle on the tongue with the vanilla and tannic nuances of American oak. The beer finishes dry, but the deliciousness of the hops and oak linger a bit leaving you longing for another sip.\r\n\r\nThis beer is also being placed in American Oak barrels for aging. The barrel-aged version of Ale of the Hermit is set for release late summer 2014.	8.0	60	JKuXtC	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:05.421518-06

A gourmet flavor of bittersweet chocolate surrounds the tastebuds and melds with the full-bodied beer to make this sensation last and last. Not too dry, not too sweet, Dark & Stormy blends the two into a wonderful semi-sweet taste. The high alcohol imparts a comfortable warming feel, but is perfectly balanced with the flavors and aromas. A nice coffee bitterness lingers on the finish, enticing you to take another sip.	9.5	50	am38FS	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:06.453963-06

A wonderful warming effect makes this beer a perfect holiday treat! Available from October thru December.	5.5	25	pPUkYK	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:06.454756-06

1531	3acf1e2d-a537-4e79-b8ac-f6cfe8dbf09a	Airdale Horizon	Airdale Horizon, is a style of wheat beer (weissbier).  It is made with a typical ratio of 40:60, or even higher, wheat to barley malt.  This beer is light, bright, and zippy on the palate with an often dry and tart edge, coupled with some hop spiciness.  Little hop bitterness permeates the beer and it possesses a moderate level of alcohol.  The “Hefe” prefix means “with yeast”, hence the beers unfiltered and cloudy appearance.  Often served with a lemon wedge (popularized by Americans), to either cut the wheat or yeast edge, which many find to be a f lavorful snap.	4.9	12	M8bVwa	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:06.455549-06

1538	1bc80913-63b8-4a6d-ad65-67b9d9e13c70	Ajax Pilsner	Try our Ajax Pilsner. This beer is a crisp and thirst quenching lager, a beer that’s a bit lower on the alcohol scale than our other offerings, allowing that après ski party to last well into the night. Saaz and Sterling hops are what Head Brewer PJ Goudreault generously doses our Ajax Pilsner with, allowed to mellow with age, these hops provide the definition of a ‘bouquet’ for a beer. Ajax Pilsner does not have the bitterness that can be found in the Independence Pass Ale, or even the Conundrum Red ESB, but instead has just the right amount of delicious floral character.\r\n\r\nAjax, like that cartoon guy? Nah, Ajax is Aspen’s local name for Aspen Mountain.  Visible from the brewery—come on, lets be honest—visible from everywhere in Aspen, Aspen Mountain dominates the southern sky. Offering amazing skiing both for the tree- and groomer-lovers alike, Ajax has everything… but beginner runs (no green circles on Ajax!). So, keep Aspen local, impress the locals, and order an Ajax Pilsner after shredding the gnar pow pow of Ajax Mountain.	4.5	40	DFJoPF	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:06.461044-06

The flavor is intense- anise, molasses, and spicy phenolics come to mind. The barrel character is subtle but overall this beer wears its alcohol on its sleeve; sit down with a bottle or else bring a tripod. We've initially baptized this beer 'Akademik,' drawing on the Akademik Shokalski Russian research vessel that was stuck in Antarctic ice last January for over a month (our fermentation exhibited similar characteristics). We rescued the stuck fermentation with a strong yeast strain whereby the 2 strains melded into a wonderful experiment.	11.0	\N	ZU5POb	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:06.466971-06

1551	b7a42d36-22c5-42a4-b93c-4b4c2307b2c9	Akevitt Porter	Akevitt Porter is a very special brew, this is a powerful porter that has been aged in old Akevitt barrels for several months. We use this technique to blend the 2 flavours and the process has produced a very special beer. We think the flavour of this beer must be very close to how historic porters tasted in the old days when all beers were kept in oak barrels. The wood aging has made this beer fantastically round and smooth, the spill over of the Akevitt flavours and of course the wood flavours play together. All this combined with the darker malts makes it unique. And the aroma is so powerful and interesting it just makes you beg for a sip.	10.0	32	kgnQYJ	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:06.470629-06

In order for the British to export their dark ales to the northern ports of the Baltic Sea, they were brewed stronger than normal to endure the long voyage. The extra warmth was welcomed in these countries with harsh winters and a taste for the robust, attributes that also fare well in Alaska.	\N	\N	et42fN	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:07.604442-06
1567	7b53be52-b7ab-476e-8384-e8efdc160b4a	Alaskan Barley Wine Ale	Originating in England in the 19th century, barley wine is a style of strong ale so named because many versions have a high alcohol content comparable to wines of the same era. American barley wines feature big malt character and high residual sweetness, counterbalanced by the generous addition of hops. \r\n\r\nAlaskan Barley Wine is a full bodied ale, deep mahogany in color and brewed with an array of complementing malts to achieve its high original gravity. Multiple hop additions in the boil and dry hopping during fermentation provide contrast to the big malt character resulting in the smooth balance that distinguishes this specialty brew. Like many fine wines, Alaskan Barley Wine may be aged in the bottle and gains deeper malt complexity and smoothness over time. \r\n\r\nAlaskan Barley Wine has been produced in limited edition vintages each year since its introduction in 2003. A big beer for big winters, this brew has garnered a steady following in Alaska. Bottled for the first time in 2007, the balanced flavor collaboration between hops, malt and high alcohol showcases the barley wine style, winning first place at the 2007 Toronado Barley Wine Festival and bronze at the 2008 World Beer Cup.	10.4	\N	u6lzyp	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:07.605454-06

Lightly toasted and caramel malts highlight the aroma with noticeable undertones of birch, figs and spun sugar. The flavor is also lightly malty with a delicate earthy or floral sweetness at the front that develops into a soft but not cloying mouthfeel. The birch syrup adds a subtle woodsy and sherry-like character that mingles with the hop bitterness to create clean and dry finish that nicely masks the spice of alcohol in this medium-bodied beer.	8.5	20	5tQxrc	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:07.606475-06

Known as "rauchbier" in Germany, smoke-flavored beers were virtually unknown in the U.S. until Alaskan Smoked Porter was developed in 1988.\r\n\r\nThe dark, robust body and pronounced smoky flavor of this limited edition beer make it an adventuresome taste experience. Alaskan Smoked Porter is produced in limited "vintages" each year on November 1 and unlike most beers, may be aged in the bottle much like fine wine. \r\n\r\nIntroduced in 1988, Alaskan Smoked Porter has been credited with helping inspire an American revival of smoked beers. Alaskan Smoked Porter is one of the most award-winning beers in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and a perennial winner at the World Beer Cup.	6.5	45	39bZWW	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:07.616462-06

1679	7dbffdcb-8479-49fb-8237-b89ed994ee41	Alfred Brown	In 1859, Alfred Brown Peticolas opened the first Peticolas law firm in the State of Texas. After briefly leaving his practice to fight in the Civil War, A.B. returned to the practice of law in 1866. Since that time, A.B., his son (Warner Marion), grandson (William Craig), great grandson (Edward Kent), and/or great-great grandson ( Michael) have continuously practiced law in the State of Texas. \r\n\r\n Named after Alfred Brown Peticolas, our English brown ale is a dialed back version of the American interpretation. It’s copper in color with a pleasantly light hop aroma, which is balanced with a delicate roasty maltiness. Notes of nut and chocolate are subdued, but clearly present in flavor. This beer’s body is medium-light and possesses a smooth texture with a hint of residual sweetness. \r\n\r\n The roasted characteristics of this beer make it the perfect match for any meats or vegetables prepared on the grill.\r\n\r\n A little more on A.B. Peticolas? He was born in Richmond, Virginia, on May 27, 1838. As a young man, he studied law and taught school. He began his practice in Virginia, but ultimately moved west to Victoria, Texas. In 1859, he opened up a law practice with Samuel A. White. A.B. Peticolas may be best remembered today for his published Civil War journals and detailed pencil sketches, having served during the Sibley Campaign in New Mexico with Co. C., 4th Regiment, Texas Mounted Volunteers. After his discharge in 1865, he returned to Victoria to practice law. In 1894, A.B. Peticolas authored an index-digest to all civil cases contained in the Texas Report. This catalog became standard text of the Texas Bar Association for years. In his later years, A.B. Peticolas was known simply as the “Judge.”	5.5	25	fbPbjZ	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:11.186723-06

Then it gets double dry-hopped with Galaxy, Citra, Amarillo, Mosaic and Simcoe.	9.0	70	XZyltY	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:12.713196-06
1726	49d00a9e-d1a7-4665-944a-59b7715acec3	Always Blue	What do you do when you spend half a decade working for a digital video compression company in the IPA sodden city of San Diego, you leave America's Finest City to open a brewery in the nucleus of the tech industry, and you have a penchant for manipulating data? You brew Always Blue Westcoast IPA, a hyper-dry India Pale Ale with a laser beam of hop aromas and a desolate landscape of malt character. Upon launch this IPA scores big with immense hop-derived notes of juicy papaya, sun-ripened pears, and lemon blossom; perfectly showcasing the complimentary shaft angle that Simcoe and Lemon Drop hops share as they stand tip to tip waiting for the beer to finish. More bitter than a predatory flautist and with sweetness that is harder to find than the floating island community of Arallon, we like to think of Always Blue as the Westcoast IPA version 2.0.	6.6	\N	c7Sc62	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:12.735099-06

Our Alternate Takes series offers a peek into our iterative & creative R&D process, where each batch is celebrated as its own off-centered hit.\r\n\r\nAlternate Takes #5 is our fruit-forward sour beer rounded by tartness & hints of vanilla & oak. This beer started as a blonde ale fermented with raspberries & aged in red wine barrels with brettanomyces & lactobacillus before being blended & additionally aged with insane amounts of blueberry. The mild brett funk plays well off the bright berry character which is balanced by a soft lactic sourness.\r\n\r\nCOLOR\r\nDeep ruby red with shades of plum\r\n\r\nAROMA\r\nBlack raspberry, boysenberry jam & a mild brett funk\r\n\r\nFLAVOR\r\nRich dark berry & cherry flavors followed by tartness & vanilla bean\r\n\r\nMOUTHFEEL\r\nMedium body, finishes dry & tart	8.0	6	B5AXsx	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:12.714392-06

The color has a subtle pink hue from the addition of hibiscus to the cloudy beer. The full aroma swirls with citrus and fruity esters due to the addition of blood orange and the particular qualities of the yeast.\r\n\r\nAs an American wheat ale, the AlpenGlow has slightly more hop character and less of the classic hefeweizen clove and banana flavors than its German weissbier cousins. \r\n\r\nAlpenglühen or Alpenglow occurs in the high mountains when the light off of the snow and ice takes on a pink to red hue. The optical phenomenon lasts only a few minutes, and only occurs with the correct conditions. The sun has to be below the horizon, so the light has to reflect and refract off of airborne ice crystals. A unique soft and warm mood is set.	4.7	14	NbuXgx	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:15.420065-06

1749	f1b38d78-5dff-4f62-ab11-f41c18b9a6e1	Alpers Trout Pale Ale	Working with Tim Alpers, father of the famed Eastern Sierra Alpers Trout, we put together a well rounded grain bill comprised of 2-Row Pilsner, 2-Row Pale, Munich, Crystal 15 and White Wheat malts to compliment the heavy additions of Cascade, CTZ, Mt. Hood, and Crystal hops.  This beer weighs in around 5.8% ABV with 35 IBUs and a light 6.6 SRM color profile.  Combined with our phenomenal water, the primarily Pilsner malt grain bill provides a nice, slightly creamy mouth feel, with the strong citrus notes compliments of the Cascade and CTZ hops.  In the finish hints of spicy can be found from the Crystal and Mt. Hood aroma hop additions after the boil during the whirlpooling process.	5.8	35	og7kus	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:15.430943-06
1750	6abe3fd7-8ab6-48f7-b6c4-11038d82b817	Alpha	Alpha, the first entry in our one-off, brewer's choice series is a Belgian-style Pale Ale at 6.2% ABV. Brewed with Pale, Carahell and Wheat malts, Amarillo and Cascade hops. This medium bodied beer is crisp on the palate with a smooth, not overly bitter hops flavor coupled with the fruity esters from the Belgian Abby yeast strain we used. Its bottle and keg conditioned, so expect a tall, fluffy head, and perhaps small amount of sediment. Just one batch was brewed in April 2008, kegs released in late May, and only 20 cases of bottles for sale only at the brewery at the special debut night event of June 13, 2008, from 5 to 8 pm. Recipe by Jeff Musselman, assistant brewer.	6.2	\N	CAlXH2	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:15.432412-06

Alley-oop is a football and basketball term that generally means a high arching pass. In basketball, another player (hopefully on the same team) catches the ball in mid air and dunks it into the basket. The name is said to derive from the French expression “Allez! Hop!” (Go! Jump!), which circus performers would yell just before taking off on the high wire trapeze.	\N	\N	Pl2Ndz	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:17.380351-06

The beer uses more hops than any brew we’ve made so far, yet still has an aroma spiked with floral and fruity notes rooted in a high temperature fermentation using the brewery’s house saison yeast. Bitterness is moderate for a double IPA at 65 ibu’s but is accentuated by a long and biting finish. 8.1% abv	8.1	\N	d3VjTl	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:18.987584-06

The brand new “Science is the Art” Collection showcases their brewers’ scientific exactitude through distinctive commissioned artistry. Featuring vibrant and energetic graphic novel-like labels, the collection will feature six expertly crafted, flavorful episodes that depict a short story throughout 2018. The first episode titled ‘All is Well at the Station’, is set to release early-January.\r\nThe six releases feature new flavor profiles, and each label is an episode in a six-part story, as interpreted by sci-fi artist, Christopher Balaskas. These unconventionally named beers each serve as a snapshot of an unfolding science fiction tale. ‘All is Well at the Station’ is an 8.5% ABV, double IPA featuring Amarillo, Chinook, CTZ, and Simcoe hops, giving this brew a big citrusy and earthy character with a dank edge. It is a remarkably drinkable double IPA as the malt bill leaves just enough residual sweetness to perfectly balance its hoppiness. As for the artwork, we see an astronaut flying above a tranquil moon outpost. Surely all is well…or is it?	8.5	80	o05yrm	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:21.240695-06

The two brewers settled on a hopfenweizen, a style that emerged within the last decade, and melds American brewers’ skillful use of hops with the centuries-old German hefeweizen tradition. The collaborative brew’s  apricot and orange aromas come from a healthy dose of U.S. grown hops, including the experimental Yellow Sub hop blend that Great Lakes contributed to the mix.	\N	\N	O6uW6L	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:21.258762-06

The hard water found in the region played a special role in producing this specialty. In his book “Beer International”, the world-renowned English beer writer, Michael Jackson, accurately describes the Ayinger “Altbairisch Dunkel” as: “A good example of its kind. Impenetrably dark with a golden-brown gleam when held up to the light, and with a warm aroma and malty taste, while summoning up coffee taste sensations on going down. It is brewed from five types of malt (two of which are torrified dark), and it is only lightly hopped.” It is produced using the traditional double fermentation process.	5.0	\N	wovmWk	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:21.678244-06

1935	be415e85-3746-4ba7-9240-66f4de238d3c	Altbier	“Alt” means “old beer” in a sense of an old-time style. This beer was brewed in the German tradition using ale yeast at cooler ale temperatures, then long cold aged to produce a slightly hoppy, well attenuated, balanced ale, with the smooth clean crispness of a lager. The bronzed copper color and subtle malt characters come from 2-Row, Munich and Black Malts. Traditional Hallertau noble hops provide for the assertive Dusseldorf hop profile.	\N	\N	Sp83Le	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:21.694324-06

Needless to say, this beer pairs very well with a slice of pecan or pumpkin pie. Cheers to winter, slow food, and the pursuit of deliciousness.	5.4	26	hA1ZSM	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:23.438759-06

2014	68c71da2-d198-41ba-aa2c-5988abb5e95c	Amelia	Amelia is our loganberry mead, and our newest addition to the Schramm family roster. In the early 1880’s Santa Cruz fruit breeder James Harvey Logan interbred Aughinbaugh blackberries with Red Antwerp raspberries, and the loganberry was born. Over a century later, in 2016, so was Amelia Schramm Naeger. Deep red in color, this melomel lets the bright tartness and natural acidity of the berries shine through, expertly balanced by Orange Blossom honey sweetness. Like this mead’s namesake, Amelia is expected to develop and mature for many years.	14.0	\N	KdTsak	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:23.452543-06

2098	86d15a61-104b-45ed-8730-32658b647fae	Amber	Invented for the Liége exposition of 1905 to compete with British imports, the Spéciale Belge or Belgian pale ale style marries the complexity of Belgium’s beers to the drinkability of Britain’s pale ales. Dageraad Amber’s light malty sweetness and rich bouquet of malt and stone fruit are balanced by a hoppy aroma and a crisp finish. This beer was inspired by the experience of enjoying a fresh bolleke − Antwerp locals’ affectionate nickname for a glass of De Koninck − in the Dageraadplatz, just a stone’s throw from the De Koninck Brewery.\r\n\r\nDageraad Amber is fermented with Belgian yeast and bottle conditioned for natural carbonation, and an extra layer of complexity. Pour with care to leave the yeast sediment in the bottle.	6.0	\N	uRgSZJ	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:25.045037-06

2105	7bee6329-4c19-4370-8a84-55474cf74ca1	Amber	When Jürgen Knöller arrived in Montana in 1987 to take up his position as Brewmaster for Bayern Brewing, he was given the task of creating a beer that would win the hearts and tastebuds of Montanans who wanted, according to popular demand, a beer that is a traditional German Märzen beer with a distinctive hop flavor. After some consideration, Jürgen came up with Bayern Amber Lager. To reach this delicate middle ground, Bayern Amber is made with the same type and quantity of malted barley used in German Märzenbiers (an amber, rich "festbier"), and then hopped in the manner of existing Czech-style pilseners. So go ahead, have a Bayern Amber and taste Bayern’s legacy, which has become a bit of living Montana history.	5.4	23	jRh8X6	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:25.049817-06

Abita Amber was the first beer offered by the brewery and continues to be our leading seller. Amber is Abita’s most versatile beer for pairing with food. It has been voted "best beer" in numerous New Orleans reader polls and is used frequently in recipes of great Louisiana chefs.\r\n\r\nBecause of its smooth, malty flavor, try it with smoked sausages, Louisiana boudin, or even with caviar. It’s great with crawfish and Cajun food. You might also enjoy it paired with a spicy gumbo or tomato-based pasta sauce. It also goes well also with fried catfish dipped in a tart, lemony tartar sauce. Parmesan, Pecorino and Romano cheeses are good pairings with Abita Amber.	4.5	17	hWi4H5	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:25.055275-06

2135	beb74c8e-d3cb-4cab-bdc2-a1706f293a14	American Expedition	From sea to shining sea was once only a dream. This dream became a reality thanks to a band of 33 travelers who braved the western expanse of America. Lead by two of America’s greatest expeditionaries, they traveled over the mountains and valleys, through the plains and across the rivers, building friendships and narrowly escaping death from their enemies. Starvation nearly took them, but the steadfast devotion and help of a native woman brought them to eternal glory. Let us remember the Corps of Discovery with the American Expedition, a light bodied American wheat ale. Bathed in farmers honey and spiced with ginger, it will give any traveler the fortitude and perseverance to carry on.	4.5	15	a6jOU7	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:26.485122-06

2169	2678d0c5-2adc-4e28-9598-fd910b0fbebb	Amber Ale	Let us introduce the "red headed step child" of our beer portfolio. This beer is commonly over looked and is a true Ninja of a beer. While the malt and hops give this beer an amazing copper color, medium body, and a smooth mouth feel, it's the yeast that sets this one apart from other amber ales. Inspired by almost everything from Belgium (beer, women, mussels) we thought it would be cool to give our Amber a little Belgian love. So we used a yeast that is ALMOST like a Belgian yeast strain. You'll notice it in the aroma but mostly in the flavor. Mild hints of light fruit and clove are present at the very end of the sip, just enough to keep you coming back for another sip.	6.0	\N	fFxVKX	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:27.126902-06

2195	14485945-1ffc-4025-ab6c-29fa2164f9d6	Amber Ale In The Groves	The malt bill for this beer consists mostly of pale malt called Maris Otter, regarded as one of the finest brewing malts in the world. This is set off with generous quantities of Munich and Crystal malts, which add sweetness, and torrified wheat to keep the head white and fluffy. \r\n Our Malt comes from Warminster Maltings, a traditional Victorian floor malt house just down the road in Wiltshire. They produce the finest malts available and are a thoroughly nice bunch. \r\n This Amber Ale boasts subtle fruit and pine flavours with a smooth malt presence. Brewed with our firm favourite Amarillo hop, alongside the pear and apple notes of our stylish newcomer, Calypso.\r\n YEAST: Fermented with Safale S-05\r\n 500 ML BOTTLES ・ BOTTLED ON: 05/07/13 ・ BEST BEFORE: 04/01/14 ・ BATCH: 1 ORIGINAL GRAVITY: 1.054 ・ FINAL GRAVITY: 1.014 ・ IBU: 40	5.2	40	dfrbyO	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:27.149227-06

This beer was brewed with large amounts of hops, which acted as a natural preservative in transit from the British Isles to India giving it the distinctive bitter taste. Modern Microbreweries now attempt to make IPAs as bitter as possible. Not us. We make it with an International bitterness rating of around 55. The taste is not overwhelmed with bitterness, but it allows you to enjoy the brilliant subtlety of the complex hops, aromas and flavors of four different hops used to finish our IPA.	7.2	55	rU1goh	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:27.782716-06

2273	c614e1e0-78d3-4427-a6c8-db4664d500a0	Anonymous IPA	Covington Brewhouse’s Anonymous IPA is the first result of a scientist and a rock n roll brewmaster buying the best kept secret in downtown Covington, Louisiana. The recipe was formulated almost a year ago. It’s something our brewmaster has been sneaking into events with for the past few months as a secret. That’s where the name anonymous came from. Questions like “what is this?” and “where can I get this?” were answered by “It’s anonymous” creating the buzz for our “Anonymous IPA”. The beer is a blend of six different malts, five different hops and a lot of tender love and care from our brewing team. The maltiness and beautiful darker than average color comes from the Munich, Aromatic and Caramel malts with a splash of pale chocolate malt. The amazing hop flavor and aroma created by the five different hops are going to remain anonymous. So far nobody has figured them out. This brave new beer is brewed by and for innovators. Go ahead. Expect the exceptional. We think you’ll like what’s brewing.	6.2	60	Z6jRfL	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:47.866443-06

It is malty and refreshing with a light hop addition for minimum bitterness. By using traditional Belgian malts and yeast, this beer has its own unique aromatic qualities. Since much of its flavor is derived from the authentic yeast strain it is gently filtered to prevent the delicate flavors from being stripped away. As is the custom in Belgium and the Netherlands, a touch of dried orange, cumin and coriander is added to round out the flavor.	\N	\N	mLc2h6	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:48.337789-06

From the angel's seat, a conductor could watch the train, looking for hot boxes (overheated wheel bearings) or fires started by hot cinders flying out of the locomotive. It's the highest seat on the train. Our Angel Seat Amber Ale will put you in the best seat in the house, too.

2314	a01448de-cc7a-490b-9e16-02fb18a3d9ea	Angel's Share	Down in Kentucky and across the pond in Scotland, distillers who age their whiskeys for many years refer to the evaporation of the spirits from their barrels as “The Angel’s Share.” We couldn’t agree more. Each time a barrel is filled, a measure of liquid seeps into the oak and is lost for good.\r\nThis striking Strong Ale is brewed with copious amounts of Caramel malt to emphasize the vanilla and oak flavors found in freshly emptied bourbon or brandy barrels. The beer spends a year in oak before it is packaged for release. The beer is 12.5% ABV and is available in 375ml and 750ml bottles and on draft at inspired locations.	14.7	\N	ikoDPe	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:48.325751-06

2361	576c3343-9bb5-467e-b26e-57aad248e3a1	Anniversary Ale 9	For this year's birthday beer we've teamed up with renowned street artist, Mike Watt, to create a collaboration brew with a difference.\r\n\r\n"Besides great beer, our other true pleasure in life is visual art," says Murray. "Every beer we brew has its own distinct personality and design. And now, we're introducing art to our anniversary, creating a limited edition bottle design in collaboration with guru, Mike Watt."\r\n\r\nMike Watt is an Australian artist and illustrator based in Sydney. His mediums vary from biro, spray paint, brush and ink to digital. He describes his style as "kind of gritty and ugly", normally showing characters with lots of personality that have lived an interesting life.\r\n"It's always great collaborating with Murray's. They're really into their craft and they make amazing beer. I love working with anyone who is passionate about what they do - when it's making amazing beer it makes it even better!" said Mike Watt.\r\n\r\nMurray's Anniversary Ale is always oak aged, always big and always a very limited release of around 1000 bottles. While this year's special brew gives a nod to its roots, reflecting the original recipe brewed to launch the company on New Year's Eve nine years ago, the recipe twist is aging the beer on Hunter Valley red wine barrel staves.\r\n\r\n"These staves will not only add flavour and aroma from the inside surfaces that have been in contact with the red wine, but will also add raw oakiness from the outside surfaces of the staves," said Head Brewer, Graeme Mahy. "The end result of the staves provides a unique combination of part oaky, part red wine flavours."\r\n\r\nAn English-style barley wine, this year's Anniversary Ale features warming rich fruit cake-like sweetness from the caramel and roasted malts, with strong aromas of stone fruit and an assertive but balanced bitterness in the finish.\r\n\r\nThis big beer can be enjoyed now, however, we advise patience will be rewarded. Cellaring for 5-10 years (if you can) is recommended to maximise enjoyment from the maturing flavours.\r\n\r\n"If you just can't hold out for 10 years, then try some over Christmas with a Christmas fruit pudding. Or in the New Year, with some ultra-rich and strong blue cheese," adds Graeme.	10.0	\N	SlLcNo	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:48.351747-06

Flavors and aromas of malt, chocolate and dark fruits emanate from a deep black sea of vienna and roasted malts. After lagering for weeks, the resulting quaff is a smooth, full-bodied, multi-dimensional experience.	9.0	30	Umo9y6	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:48.354076-06

With a deep mahogany hue and fermented with an Alt yeast strain, it offers a clean toasted malt profile, finishing with a bright citrus and floral hop presence. We conditioned this beer on 80 pounds of chocolate nibs from Theo Chocolates in Seattle with the addition of rich Guatemalan coffee from Water Avenue Coffee in Portland.\r\n\r\nAncient Aleiens has a deep dark cocoa taste up front that warms into a sweet coffee expression, finishing with a fruity hop aroma. Smooth toasted malt flavor balances the rich cocoa bitterness. It has the brown hue of iced coffee with a tan head. The coffee sweetens the beer in the middle, lending to nutty, caramel, and chocolate coffee flavors. Flavors swirl to a focused, clean finish, ready for the next silky, rich sip.	7.1	60	sLjRjQ	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:48.486752-06

Each batch is an incarnation of the ancient soul…”\r\n\r\nAncient Soul Lifetime #1 is the first of our reincarnation series…it can be likened to the stages of metamorphosis that we see in nature, such as egg, caterpillar, chrysalis, butterfly.  In the stages of soul evolvement there is a search for balance and completion.  But is the soul ever really complete?\r\n\r\nEach ingredient balances this creation, the wildflower honey takes from the oak barrel to complete the cycle.  Our aging for 6+ months in oak barrels, is done to guide the wildflower honey  to merge with the barrels smooth hints of oak  and have the floral notes to blossom once again.   It will not stop there.  We have not overthrown the lessons of the stages of the transformation in flavor.  We pull from this experience to help create the reincarnation of more flavors to come in the future.\r\n\r\nIt is a long journey but that’s okay because the soul is eternal.\r\n\r\nThis is just the B. ginning.\r\n\r\nWe return from whence we came, and present you a traditional Wildflower mead aged in oak barrels.

The ever increasing terrors of man quickly turned into global devastation on an epic scale. Apes were forced from their natural habitats, sequestered on urban streets that lay under ruins from the carnage, and left to forage for basic life-giving necessities. Their immune systems, superior to man's, still required the use of gas masks for survival, while humans barely clung to life. Relegated to roaming the harsh terrain in search of a mortal's cure, this series of barrel aged imperial stouts represent the last hope for mankind's resurgence, as we lay on the brink of Ape Armageddon.	11.0	65	RzMj8N	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:48.7023-06

The beer is a perfect presentation of toasted malt that is supported by a subtle hop character. This beer pairs well with transitional seasons when we're looking for something less intense but not too light, offering light roasty and caramel flavors. A very drinkable beer, weighing in at a reasonable 6.6% ABV, this American Amber Ale is a classic favorite.	6.6	40	oPSEMK	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:48.710722-06
2445	3eebf289-6b8f-4fc5-83f2-6522741afc0d	Apex Predator	When you brew as much as we do, sometimes we get tired of telling the yeast what to do. For Apex Predator Farmhouse Ale, we pitch the yeast cold, turn off the temperature control, and let the yeast do it's thing. To our delight, it spat out the sweet scent of juicy fruit wafting from a frothy, white mane. Brewed only with grain and sugar unencumbered by the heat of the kiln, we create a hazy, golden body. Apex Predator gets its teeth from a generous Crystal dry-hopping that completes the dry finish with a fruity bite. Pounce on the opportunity to let it part your lips and you may find yourself at the top of the food chain.	6.5	25	8GqgIG	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:48.711977-06

2468	37536d70-3182-4c57-b572-76e511621848	Aphrodite	In Greek mythology, Aphrodite rises from the foam of the\r\n waves of the sea, enchanting all who see her, and inciting thoughts of love and lust where ever she goes.\r\n\r\nWe could hardly say it more eloquently. Our Limited Edition Aphrodite Ale is ethereal, intriguing and mysterious – as the Goddess Aphrodite\r\n must have been. Aphrodite has champagne-like carbonation, much as the foam of the waves of the sea. Plus enchanting flavors with whispers of raspberry and pear, and hints of funk and tartness created by the Brett yeast. The refreshing dryness comes from the unusual combination of Ommegang and Brett yeasts, and incites feelings of love and thirst, though we don’t know about lust. Grains of paradise are infused into the nectar, and when poured Aphrodite is crowned with a luxuriously shimmering rose-pink head.	8.9	19	NtcmVN	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:48.723128-06

Its colour may be intimidating, but it is a very smooth beer within reach of most beer drinkers. This highly appreciated dessert beer is brewed with organic fair-trade cocoa and first rate vanilla beans.	6.5	\N	LxMkSR	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:48.724404-06
2474	1adec195-36b7-4c4a-8297-ba7e5bc545e2	Aphrodite Hopfenweisse	"The beer that loves you back, Aphrodite is a 'hopfenweisse': basically a bigger, much hoppier wheat beer. It is brewed with a high proportion of wheat malt and uses a blend of a classic German Weizen yeast and Murray's house ale blend. Loads of hops were added late in the boil and to the whirlpool with no conventional bittering addition at all resulting in big hop flavour and aroma but restrained bitterness.	6.9	\N	PJ85bI	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:48.725608-06
2477	44e9231a-7399-4dc0-9888-161f00f3fd3e	Apiarius	Apiarius is not a sweet beer, though it is brewed with a generous charge of honey from our own hives (or from our neighbors’ hives when we run out). We achieve a crisp, dry pale ale from sweet beginnings by fully fermenting all of the sugars- this yields a satisfying but muted maltiness, a refreshing hop character, and a captivating honey-flower aroma and finish.\r\n\r\nApiarius is brewed from a grist containing organic base malt, the finest quality specialty malts, and a huge bucket of our own honey.  This highly sessionable beer uses both English and American hops: a fairly cool mash and a fairly warm ferment bring out the esters in the malt and make this a nicely warming quaff.	5.5	25	iMS6nk	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:48.726671-06

2519	0f5c7a3a-cfa7-4d41-8d78-265ebcd0f7de	American Standard Ale	American Standard is an all-American Session Pale Ale; hand crafted using premium American ingredients. This beer displays a bright hop flavor and aroma, yet very little bitterness. To achieve this flavor profile, we used no bittering hops. Instead we emphasized the hop character with a first wort addition, then twenty minute and whirlpool additions. Each of these processes adds flavor, while yielding minimal bitterness.\r\n\r\nWe used Cascade and Amarillo hops, which impart a distinctive and refreshingly citrusy character, reminiscent of tangerines and grapefruit. This beer is also generously dry hopped, using the same Cascade and Amarillo hops. Our choice of malt is simple, employing wheat flakes for added body and a pillowy mouth feel, along with a touch of Biscuit malt for a slightly toasty note. Light crystals are also in the mix, which impart a bright golden color.	5.0	\N	M6gMvk	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:48.747785-06

For our third batch of beer we let the cooler temperatures influence the brewing process. The result was a remarkable variation on Mystic Saison. The hops are brighter, the drinkability fantastic, and balance of flavors intriguing. Because of this venture into old ways of brewing (and the distinct differences they create), we called this beer "An Dreoilin" after an ancient druid festival of the winter solstice.	\N	\N	hAz8xm	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:53.414427-06

Therefore it is what it is – which is to say that it displays a very Belgian character due to the yeast strain.  You may notice that this beer is very different from our St. Marks Dubbel.  That is because we use an entirely different yeast strain for this one.\r\n\r\nThe aroma is heavy on the caramelized banana side with a dash of licorice.  We don’t filter the Angry Monk, nor any of our other Belgian-style beers, however, one distinguishing characteristic of this particular yeast strain is that it is highly flocculating which means it leaves the beer very clear and bright without sacrificing any flavors.	6.8	30	5v5HyB	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:53.535743-06

Featuring Cascade hops and a large dry hop addition, together create an aroma of citrus and light toast and carries a nice flavorful punch of citrus hop that is balanced by a slight caramel sweetness which plays off on the hop's bitterness. Angry Planet pairs well with yak momo, pizza & pad thai as well as burgers and brats off the grill.	6.0	48	tZqsYb	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:53.540889-06

This 6% ABV treasure has a fiery personality (attributed to the spicy chinook hops) that will stick with you, and a malty, seductive snarl that will have you begging for mercy, or more, depending how the bitterness sits at the back of your throat. She may punch, and bite, but it's everything you want in a Redhead.	\N	\N	zKhXvH	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:53.542603-06

2621	9a88c247-7518-42cf-83d8-f9465e5cfaa9	Amber Saison	Amber Saison is a Belgian-Style Ale featuring complex, yeast-derived esters and phenolics with nice background maltiness and a low bitterness. The special yeast used in brewing this beer creates flavors of spices, notably nutmeg and clove and bright fruit notes to accompany. An element of malt sweetness comes in to balance the yeast notes. The beer finishes with a bright carbonation and a crisp dryness.\r\n\r\nThe Saison style originated in the France/Belgian border region of Wallonia. Saison is not a single style, but more a family of beers. They were originally made in small farmhouse breweries and could vary greatly in color & flavor from farm to farm. The word “saison” means “season” in French and Saison beers were usually brewed seasonally and used as payment & fortification for seasonal farm laborers known as “saisonnaires”. Many of the original Saison beers were produced in conditions that allowed wild yeasts to colonize them and impart flavors. These Brettanomyces yeasts are now being used by modern brewers to help replicate some of the flavors of the past. We age our Amber Saison in oak barrels with added Brettanomyces for a special fall release in our Barrel Roll Series that we call Falling Leaf.	6.6	19	bw4jpI	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:53.541357-06

2652	d6b372f7-327e-4757-b9cd-d47ab61025ec	Anja	The second beer in our Pro-Am series is an extremely refreshing and tasty Belgian Pale Ale. This beer starts with an intriguing, complex bouquet of clove, banana, bubblegum and spicy esters. Soft, sweet flavors of doughy malt, vanilla and pear come in to balance the yeast notes. A nice, crisp bitterness from the German Saphir hops help to round out this well-balanced brew.\r\n\r\nTraditional Belgian “Single” or “Table” beers are meant to be served as everyday sessionable beer often enjoyed at meals. Our version was a collaborative effort between the Hangar 24 Brewing Staff and homebrewer Scott Gaastra. Scott’s original recipe beat out 245 other entries to win our 2nd Annual Homebrew Competition in May 2011. Scott then helped our staff to recreate his beer on our brewing system. This beer will be entered into the 2011 GABF Pro-Am competition.	5.6	33	wTSOR6	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:53.554563-06

The seasonal beer goes through the same progression. We wanted to make a darker beer that had a lot of hop character blending the recent harvest with the upcoming winter.  To accomplish the feat we used plenty of de-bittered black malt and Cascadian style hops. To accompany the shoulder season, the beer retains a thinner body with a nice blend of NW hops and the dark malts. We’ll call it a NW Black ale, as opposed to a Cascadian dark ale, since Annapurna has more dark malts that share the stage with the hop character.	\N	\N	04zXgv	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:53.570699-06

2752	fb807bc2-3d16-4093-8b6d-e691f7366fa8	Applalicha Alt	(Silver Medal winner Denver International) The name of this beer style comes from the German word "alt" meaning "old". This refers to the aging that alts undergo since they ferment more slowly and at colder temperatures than most ales. Slow fermentation helps condition, contributing to its overall balance and smoothness. Malty and long on the palate, with just enough hop backing to make this beautiful amber colored.	5.1	24	euEa1E	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:54.426424-06

Brabo’s Cut, the first Legendary release, told the tale of a brave Roman soldier named Silvius Brabo and his heroic deeds. Growing tired of paying tolls to cross the river Scheldt, Brabo chopped off the hand of Antigoon, the menacing giant who guarded the bridge in the city of Antwerp, slaying him and collecting a mighty reward. Now centuries later, Antigoon is out for payback, bringing with him a fiery vengeance unlike any other. The antithesis of Brabo’s Cut, Antigoon’s Revenge is a traditional big, Belgian-Style Golden Ale, untraditionally brewed with a touch of cherry-wood smoked malt. At a hefty 12.4% ABV, it’s not for the faint of heart. Notes of sweet fruit and spicy esters come through in the aroma and initial taste, with wisps of smoke finishing on the palate. Revenge never tasted so sweet.	12.4	51	vb3svE	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:54.458559-06

2816	d37bbcd2-76c3-4086-a6e8-877912f2e3db	Arctic Devil Barley Wine	Arctic Devil Barley Wine, aptly named after the ferocious wolverine of the north, is an English-style (meaning malt-inclined) barley wine. Though the recipe and process for Arctic Devil have evolved over the years, it is brewed once a year then aged in oak barrels for several months before the entire batch is blended, bottled and released. Beginning in 2010, ADBW will be released in late SEP.\r\n\r\nIn its youth, Arctic Devil gnarls and snarls its way across the palate. Containing this beast of a beer for long periods in oak barrels--some having previously aged port, wine or whiskey--tames the unleashed malt and fierce hop flavors, melding and mellowing this powerful liquid into an incredible elixir worthy of a brewer's table.\r\n\r\nEach annual batch of Arctic Devil Barley Wine represents the brewers' resolve to create an intriguing and sought-after barley wine by precisely brewing to well-designed specifications, carefully selecting the type and combination of barrels to use for aging, and meticulously checking the beer as it ages. Distinct nuance and complexity are contributed by the wood's previous tenants, resulting in unique flavor profiles in each batch that continue to change over time. We invite you to savor Arctic Devil Barley Wine upon its release then cellar some for future enjoyment.\r\n\r\nMidnight Sun's elusive Arctic Devil Barley Wine is Alaska's most awarded barley wine.	13.2	20	qeYTCJ	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:55.905731-06

2862	0138eb70-f789-487c-ac5e-9bede7f6c598	Aries	Aries is the 3rd installment in the latest round of Brewers’ Select Series beers!  Aries breaks the mold of preceding Brewers’ Select beers in that it is NOT a new beer—rather, it is a blend of two existing beers which have been being mixed by Weyerbacher employees for a few years now.  In perfect timing for October / Halloween, Aries is a delicious blend of Old Heathen Imperial Stout and Imperial Pumpkin Ale!\r\n\r\nKnown around the brewery as a “Black & Orange”, this mix is generally credited to Weyerbacher’s Philly Sales Rep Mike Lubieski as being a way to support his Flyers and also by NJ Sales Rep Natalie DeChico who got it into firkins here and there (she’s the former Philly Beer Geek and creator of Althea).  By mixing these two brews, the otherwise pretty dominant cinnamon and nutmeg spices of Imperial Pumpkin Ale are subdued by Old Heathen while highlighting the malt backbone of both beers. The result is a really balanced yet spicy dark beer which will work very well as a dessert beer and still pair nicely with your favorite fall foods.\r\n\r\nSince both Old Heathen and Imperial Pumpkin Ale are each 8% ABV, Aries is also a very manageable 8% [really complicated math here].\r\n\r\nWhen Aries was originally conceived, the plan was to mix Heresy—our Bourbon barrel-aged Old Heathen—with Imperial Pumpkin Ale.  On the day the decision had to be made, however, it was found that the brand new batch of Old Heathen actually tasted better in the mix so we switched things up a bit. The result speaks for itself!	8.0	\N	Cf2Bi3	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:47:56.480733-06

This beer has more aliases than a mafia Don: formerly known as “Bad Santa” then “Sick-Gnar”, it is now named after Armstrong Woods, but most people think it’s named after a bicyclist. The term "Double Pale" came about because the original incarnation of the recipe was literally double the Annadel Pale Ale grain bill. The recipe has since been tweaked, but the deep color, bold malty aromas and complex hop character still characterize this unique beer.	8.2	\N	wMkfZm	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:00.190452-06

3084	5931fd12-f4d4-406a-b36e-f4a40c73c27e	Ascender	Ascender is our nod to the beauty and assertive character of Amarillo hops. We brewed this IPA with a blank canvas of a grain bill consisting only of our 2-row base malt from Idaho, then added in plenty of Amarillo hops to develop a huge ruby red grapefruit character followed by more subtle notes of papaya and citron. Layering other hops from the same region of the Pacific North West provides a strong dank and resinous undertone on the finish. Bone dry and light in body, makes this intensely juicy and tropical IPA wash off the palate quickly with a nice lingering hop resin profile that leaves you wanting to crush another pint.	6.6	\N	yOfiEA	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:00.223332-06

3119	dd4f447f-1e57-4ab8-b831-90e58f247432	Ashbury Alt	Altbier is a malty, darker cousin of Kölsch.  Dusseldorf and Cologne (home of Kölsch) are less than an hour apart on the Rhine River in western Germany.  Both beers are holdovers from the German ale-brewing tradition before the widespread advance of lager-brewing (alt means old in German).  Ashbury Alt gets a boost in maltiness and mouthfeel from the addition of Munich malt as well as from the alt yeast fermentation, which tends to highlight malt notes (unlike our Kölsch yeast, which emphasizes hop character).  The German hops add a pleasing touch of spiciness to balance the malt sweetness.  In a way, coming from our anglophile perspective on brewing, altbiers are somewhat similar to English bitters.  Just don’t say that to a German brewer.	4.0	40	74eOTv	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:00.232865-06

3086	2ea7ccbc-0da2-4f32-bfbb-2e55b120242a	Automatic	We are bringing back our seasonal American Pale Ale, Automatic!  Automatic is a modern pale ale with an ABV of 5.2-­‐percent that features a prominent hop flavor and aroma. The beer appears hazy and straw colored with densely packed and persistent white foam. A mix of Mosaic and Crystal hops are used to create a delicate balance and give the beer an aroma that features a complex array of berry, citrus, herbal and pine notes.\r\n\r\n“Automatic is meant to be light, refreshing and quite drinkable without falling into the common pitfall of ending up too thin, watery or insipid. No color malts were used, however, the relatively full mouthfeel is enough to support this heavily hopped beer,” says Co-­Founder and Brewmaster Adam Beauchamp. “The flavor mirrors the aroma with a bit more earthiness and stone fruit, leading to a nicely balanced and moderately bitter finish.”\r\n\r\nOnce again, we collaborated with a local artist to design the can label. Athens’ painter, Michelle Fontaine was inspired by 1950s American popular culture as well as the origin of our facility – a former 1940s Chevy dealership and later the Snow Tire Company. The label she designed for Automatic has a classic automotive theme.\r\n\r\nThe name Automatic is a nod to the community in which we are located – Athens, GA. It’s a reference to the slogan of a local restaurant, Weaver D’s that inspired one of REM’s most prolific albums – Automatic for the People.	5.2	\N	T71yJt	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:00.223879-06

Brewed to be enjoyed fresh, these bright and refreshing ales capture the essence of each season’s harvest.\r\n\r\nInspired by the fruit markets of San Francisco’s Mission District, our Autumn 2011 Farmhouse Pale is an homage to indian summer in Northern California. By selecting the last organic plums of the season and blending in rich piloncillo—an unrefined brown sugar popular in Mexican desserts—we brewed a beer that celebrates both the Bay Area fall harvest and one of San Francisco’s most vibrant neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nOur first “Farm to Bottle” release is a Belgian-style farmhouse ale bursting with distinctive hop and yeast aromas. During the brew, we blended in the piloncillo and over one thousand pounds of ripe, organic California plums from the fertile orchards of Twin Girls Farm in the San Joaquin Valley. The plums add a subtle yet bright and fruity character to the beer. Next, we dosed the beer with generous helpings of Cascade and Amarillo hops. Added primarily at the end of the brewing process and then again after fermentation (dry hopping), these hop varietals give our beer it’s characteristic tangerine and grapefruit aromas.	7.0	29	wvqTEV	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:00.233363-06

Employing a blend of German Munich and Vienna malts as a base, Autumn Ale displays brilliantly clear copper, orange hues evocative of the vibrant, rich, and deep colors that surface seemingly overnight on trees this time of year in the PNW. Ester production is greatly inhibited allowing for a rounded, yet crisp malt character to fully emerge. German Hersbrucker and Czech Saaz hops contribute a moderately spicy, earthy flavor accent to this otherwise malty and smooth brew.	6.5	27	cTR4d0	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:00.235354-06

Brewed with cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, vanilla, molasses, and maple syrup, and fermented with our traditional Belgian yeast strain, this bold and spicy beer is perfect on a cold autumn evening.	10.0	\N	LxdZMi	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:00.247343-06
3171	3e52ecf8-a77b-4750-8696-e31fbef7d74d	Autumn Nugget	This wet hop (freshly picked hops from Long Island) ale gets its body from the excessive amounts of Nugget wet hops that were used in this brew, 150 pounds for 30 barrels of beer to be exact. The Nugget hop gives herbal hop flavor/aromatic that is enhanced with its fall inspired spice blend of pink peppercorns, vanilla bean pods, nutmeg and cinnamon sticks. This beer encompasses all the things you love about the Fall season and contains absolutely NO PUMPKIN!	6.5	\N	fiJ0ki	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:00.248283-06

Aroma of toasted hazelnuts and cocoa up front with the slightest hint of vanilla and caramel from the Oak - a tribute to the White Oaks of AZ and the Autumn Season. First sip is light on the body but full of flavors, ranging from sweet molasses to vanilla and burnt honey, followed late by the graham cracker like finish. Complex but not overpowering. Intricate yet pure.	8.0	25	c3PMDv	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:00.249162-06

We have balanced the strong bitterness you would expect this beer to have with huge dank aromas and a malt back bone that makes this beer so easy to drink. "This beer is right up my alley" is what Stone Brewing Founder Greg Koch said upon drinking this tasty elixir of the gods, which could only be named after one.	8.5	\N	ECR2hl	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:00.25289-06

Review the antigravity, then the powerful hopspooning. On the palate dense and harmonious. A fine remedy is played with noble notes from the valuable hops.

Clocking in at 34IBU’s, this beer is just bitter enough to keep the hopheads coming back without being crushingly dry or astringent.

3235	74298c5c-3f5c-403b-b002-2a49634e5919	Augustijn Ale	Appearance. Augustijn Ale has a foamy white head that lingers in a very thin layer on top of the beer until the last drop. It has a honey orange color and is cloudy like a gem stone but you can still through the beer enough to see the bubbles.\r\n\r\nSmell. It has the expected Belgian yeast aroma, but with a slight twist like a fresh banana that is ever so slightly green and a hint of cloves. Unexpectedly, however, this beer has a subtle but nice citrus-orange hoppy bouquet. For me, the bouquet did not last until the end, maybe the smell of food overpowered it.  There is also the aroma of sweet barley malt.\r\n\r\nTaste. Augustijn Ale has a barley malt sweetness that is wel balanced by the hop bitterness. The malt flavor is much stronger tasting than is was smelling. The sweetness of the malt is enhanced by the fresh slightly-unripe banana. The clove is more prominent in the flavor probably by the slightly spicy hop flavors. This beer went very well with the baked brie “en brioche” appetizer at the restaurant.\r\n\r\nMouthfeel. Despite being 8% alcohol by volume, this is a medium-bodied beer. From the original gravity of 1.076 and the alcohol content, I calculated the final gravity to be 1.015. Although it is clearly medium-bodied, Augustijn Ale at times seems lighter bodied. This might be due to the high alcohol content and the effervescence. The level of carbonation is pleasant and a touch higher than most North American craft beers that I have drinking lately.\r\n\r\nDrinkability. Except for Belgian witbier, I usually only want a single Belgian beer per session. The flavors are so intense that one is usually enough. Augustijn Ale, so far, is the exception. I think I enjoyed the particular balance of flavors that this beer imparts. It coudl also be the strain of yeast (which I might try harvesting for some homebrew). I found myself craving another glass immediately upon finishing the first glass. I find this to be a much more drinkable Belgian without losing any of the Belgian beer qualities.	8.0	\N	fe44im	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:00.335694-06
3236	588525e3-fca7-4c58-88c5-f23542a5f09f	Augustijn Blonde	Augustine is a 'living' abbey beer with 8% alcohol by volume, which was brewed. By the Augustinian fathers of Ghent since 1295 In 1982, the prescription and distribution of beer was taken over by brewery Van Steenberge. As was also the taste adjusted. Thanks to the improvements to the existing recipe, you can now enjoy a golden-amber colored beer with a good head. Augustine has a hoppy flavor with a malty background.

Backwoods Belgian marries the flavors of oranges, apples, a honey-sweet malt character, and a dry peppery finish, with a soft, warm alcohol presence on the palate.  Effervescent and refreshing, this full-bodied Golden Ale is our interpretation of the classic style with a touch of Southern Sweetness.	8.5	25	zTzshy	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:00.459166-06

A perfectly balanced taste and aroma. \r\n\r\nAyinger Lager Hell is often used for cooking and it can be paired with many typical Bavarian dishes like for example beef, pork and cold meat with radish and Brez’n.	4.9	\N	5rlM4R	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:00.614968-06

3355	45517820-eadf-48db-b766-1ab95cb15bf1	Azacca Attacka	Azacca is the ancient Haitian Voodoo god of agriculture. It’s said that he was a simple, barefooted hillbilly that watched over the farmers and their crops. The hops variety that bares his name is a dwarf hop that has intense tropical flavor and aroma with notes of citrus, ripe mangos, orchard fruit (pears & apples) and pine needles.\r\n\r\nAzacca Attacka is a single-hop American Pale Ale. Very sessionable at only 5% ABV, it has a mild malt backbone that lets the Azacca hops shine through.  Slight bitterness up front gives way to the prominent tropical mango flavor with hints of pear and it finishes with a lingering pine needle bitterness.	5.0	\N	lJMGtN	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:00.621359-06

After years of pirating in the Caribbean the trio were set on retiring in Virginia. They were arrested near Hampton Roads and spent nearly 3 years in prison. They were able to negotiate their freedom by giving up a large portion of their booty, which King William used for the “Charitable Purpose” of founding the College of William and Mary.	12.0	\N	a2hQIc	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:01.165718-06

These beers, now called barley wine, are brewed in the tradition of days past. At Southern Tier this long awaited brew is placed on the back burner until the start of the new year. Back Burner Barley Wine is a celebration of things to come and things remembered. It’s conceived in three small batches, using voluminous amounts of barley and hops. The process starts early in the morning and ends late into the night. We hope this rare brew reignites your spirit for another trip around the sun.	10.5	\N	oPxIne	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:01.175177-06

It’s big, rich, smooth and satisfying, yet drinkable enough to enjoy more than one. This winter ale is destined to become northwest classic.	6.8	48	nSmDRI	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:01.787083-06

Grab a seat on the porch, some soft cheese and a tree ripened apple from your grandmother's old orchard.

We aged a classic Imperial Porter in oak barrels with Colorado peaches and wild yeasts. The blend marries a bold roasted chocolate malt flavor with a subtle peach essence, and the wild yeasts create slightly tart complexities. Nonconforming and intriguing, Avant Peche entertains the palate, and inspires creative drinking.\r\nAvant Peche is currently unavailable in most of our ten state distribution. There may be one or two bottles left in some small obscure liquor store out there- if you find some proceed immediately to buy a lottery ticket- you’re having a lucky day!	\N	\N	vBKH72	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:01.790109-06

3505	d161eed2-0039-4444-bf9d-180157915608	Bardstown Barleywine	This is a strong barley wine at 10% alc/vol that was aged in Bourbon Barrels for a year. Bardstown has a wonderful aroma of vanilla, fruit, smoke, oak and alcohol. On the palate you first taste sweet malt, vanilla, ripe fruit and raisons followed closely by the warmth of alcohol and tannic oak.\r\n\r\nBardstown is the very first beer OHB has ever bottled.  It was made in very limited quantities, only about 150 cases were made.\r\n\r\nAbout the name: Bardstown is the county seat for Nelson County, Kentucky and is the host city of the annual Bourbon Festival.  Most of the famous bourbons made hail from this area of Kentucky. A few years ago Steven was visiting Bardstown and the many distillers around Kentucky.While visiting the distilleries, Steven arranged to pick up some freshly used barrels, empty less than a day.  The barrels were brought back to the brewery and filled right away. The barrels rested in the brewery for a year, full of barley wine. \r\n\r\nWhen the beer was just right, the barrels were emptied into a tank and allowed to condition before being bottled, one at a time, by hand. \r\n\r\nAs Bardstown is such a big and robust beer, as well as being 10%, it will age very well, becoming more mellow as the years pass. If you have the opportunity and the patience to keep a bottle or two back you will be well rewarded in five to ten years.	10.0	\N	PsTQTg	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:45.511978-06

It was nicer in there than it was outside, so they stayed in there until they ran out of beer. When they ran out of beer they still didn’t want to go outside so they decided it would be better if they just started brewing their beer in the sauna.

The three rings stand for Purity, Body, Flavor, and were inspired by overlapping condensation rings left from beer glasses on a table.\r\n\r\nFor much of the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, Ballantine was a primary sponsor of the New York Yankees, with team announcers designating Yankee home runs as "Ballantine Blasts." In more recent years, Ballantine has been mentioned by hip-hop artists including the Beastie Boys and GZA.\r\n\r\nToday, Ballantine still proudly displays its three interlocking rings and can be found throughout the Northeast.	4.8	\N	kvKqFa	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:49.83821-06

Seeing the beer in the glass shows the obvious resemblance to a slice of red velvet cake (red cake on the bottom topped with a layer of creamy white frosting).  But the similarities don’t end there.  The aroma is dominated by chocolate with earthy notes of beets and subtle wafts of roast coco.  The flavor is similar to the aroma but with faint roast and hop bitterness coming in at the end balance it out, not cloying or overly sweet.  The mouthfeel is medium and the finish is luxuriously smooth.  It’s dessert served in a pint glass!\r\nNote: Serve in a straight sided pint glass for full appreciation of the nitro cascade when poured.	5.5	33	lsS4Y6	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:49.841928-06

The word, "alt" is  german for "old" , and refers to the traditional style of brewing before lager yeast was discovered. Balt is a dark, copper colored brew with a creamy head, a gentle bitterness and a clean dry finish. 2012 GABF Gold medal winner, 2014 World Beer Cup Bronze medal winner.	6.0	45	dR7EQg	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:49.857005-06

They were most famously known for their hand-crafted chairs. The most coveted of these chairs denote ornate faces based on Greek and Roman mythology. Today these chairs are highly sought after by collectors.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo celebrate our 20th Century Dayton artisans, we designed a special beer. A Baltic Porter appropriately named Baltic Argonaut. So sit back in your favorite chair, Stomps – Burkhardt or otherwise, close your eyes and sip a Baltic Argonaut. Then dream about a time long ago in Dayton where myths would become legendary.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis Baltic Porter is black in color with a dense tan foam. The aroma boasts a bouquet of roasty, coffee notes with mild caramel sweetness. The malt character features lots of dark malt flavors like roast, chocolate and vanilla complimented by warming alcohol notes and hints of nutty, toffee, bready flavors.	11.5	35	KhZhq5	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:49.865193-06

The aroma is layered with a mild malty sweetness and slight hints of coconut. The flavor, however, is something truly special—toasted malt and caramel flavors, coconut, chocolate and a touch of almond all shine in this complex brew. It has hints of sweetness, but remains drinkable with a clean and refined finish.	7.4	\N	Beiqbm	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:49.86894-06

3585	4a2008bb-a20f-4a02-a13c-ac3f122a8de7	Baltic Porter	Late in the 18th century Britain's great brewing families were working hard to break into new markets. For the Baltic Sea ports they created an export version of the traditional British Porter. Styled like an IPA to preserve them for the voyage, those profound Baltic Porters served to ward off the chill winds of that northern sea.\r\n\r\nThat said, we weren't satisfied with the Baltic Porter's traditionally subtle hint of black licorice. This ale features a blend of whole licorice root and star anise to create an uncommon addition to that traditional export Porter's hearty character.	7.8	\N	6KOy5V	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:49.870926-06

Possessing those familiar European characteristics one might find, say, on a beach, we added just a hint of American style and certainly more taste. This beer started out as an amber hefeweizen, but it sorta stopped there. Healthy doses of rye and a longer cold conditioning process produced a brilliantly burnished gold colored beer—and though it might be a close race, we prefer to gaze at this beer instead of the infamous thong that inspired the name (not that there would be anything wrong with that).	\N	\N	sZoMMb	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:49.880143-06

3687	1cd3f87a-09a1-46a6-9bd5-620255369a5a	Baderbräu Red Velvet	Baderbräu Red Velvet is a contemporary take on a classic German bock, a hoppy bock if you will. Red Velvet is a deep red, full-bodied malt bomb with a pronounced hop bitterneess in the creamy head followed by big, complex, dark, and chewy malts; long, lingering caramel flavors; and a touch of delicious sweetness. Pair as you would a fine port or sauterne. Great with strong, sharp and nutty or stinky and blue-veined cheeses; nut meats; dried and sugar-plumped fruits; and chocolate- especially dark bitter. Excels with fowl, including turkey, goose, duck, pheasant, quail, and squab.	6.0	30	cOh49k	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:50.483507-06
3688	b3431075-85af-4372-9994-b3cb9721b46c	Badge	Originally brewed out of necessity to grow yeast, Badge quickly became a crowd favorite here at the brewery. The beer was released on our tours to celebrate local police officers. On release day we gave free six-packs to any licensed public safety officials as a thank you for their service and to celebrate their commitment to serving the community. The beer, and the day, turned out to be fantastic and we felt it was something worthy of doing on a larger scale.\r\n\r\nBadge tickles all the senses with complex aromas and flavors but if you’re not looking to tear it down into individual layers you’ll find it’s juicy, fruity, hop aromas and hint of lager-crisp cleanliness pleasing to the pallet. Unlike having cuffs slapped on your taste buds from a lockdown of flavors in some India-style beers, Badge leaves your senses alert and in tact.	5.5	40	46CRh6	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:50.484521-06

3718	b1573b9d-74e7-4420-bb5a-5976f9f51265	Batch 5000	Bell's Batch 5000 Ale is a smoked strong ale, brewed to celebrate Kalamazoo Brewing Company's 5000th batch. It is brewed with 26% German, beechwood-smoked malt. It is very lightly hopped which showcases the rich caramel tones of the malt body that balances the assertive smoke flavor throughout. Batch 5000 would be a wonderful pairing for robust cheeses, sausages and smoked salmon. While drinkable now, Batch 5000 has an ageing potential of several years. The interplay of flavors will mature and develop subtly with time. Avoid any extreme temperatures, and keep at a cellar temperature below 65 °F.

The beer would be best described as a hoppy American Strong Ale, aka DIPA. The concept behind it however was to embrace the strange, so we used a mix of Gambrinus Pale and Pilsner, German Caramunich II, Cascade, Centennial, Falconers Flight, Columbus, and Sterling (the stranger) with a Citra dry hop for the spice. It was then fermented with a German Ale yeast strain to leave you with a totally exotic (possibly erotic), WTF experience. Enjoy, I did! Did you?	8.7	70	L83vJG	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:56.226162-06

3754	b47ccab2-5673-4465-8de0-3d21a337823e	Batch One	Although described by the brewery as an “American Strong Ale”, it is the subtlety of Batch One that stands out. Characterized by its generous body and strong hop aromas, the beer’s robust malt profile is masterfully combined with delicate, American aroma hops. The result is a well-balanced beer, rather than the over-hopped and sickeningly sweet beers that often represent this category.\r\nBatch One has a russet, copper-like luster topped with a beige-colored foam. Simcoe hops give the beer its fresh, citrus-like character as well as a solid bitterness. This is rounded out by a sweet caramel malt. Amager Batch One is a potent beer, in both its warming alcohol and pronounced bitterness.	9.2	\N	Z2cKjO	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:56.246719-06

In order to make the voyage the brewers treated porter the way they did pale ale, i.e. doubled the bittering hops and dry hop the heck out of it. This isn’t your normal porter: intense roast character from the traditional grain bill of pale, amber, brown and black malts and a firm finish from 90 IBUs from East Kent Goldings hops. Think of it as the original black IPA! (6.1% ABV).\r\n\r\nThis beer is dedicated to Lemmy, the bassist and frontman for the band Motorhead.

The deep amber color and crisp head give way to just enough hops to add to the flavor but not too many to overpower that Earthy Basil aroma.  Anyone can do hoppy, we try and do tasty.	5.2	43	80MptX	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:56.996666-06

3861	8bf6d5a2-6710-44d1-bdb3-e8c6af56070f	Be Still	Be Still is our dark sour and presented barrel-still, without carbonation, for optimum mouthfeel and balance. Brewed with roasted barley and biscuit malts, the structure of the beer comes from acid produced by our house lactobacillus culture as well as acid from brettanomyces and pediococcus activity during the 10-month aging period in rye whiskey and fresh pinot noir barrels. Prior to bottling, the rye and wine portions are blended together and allowed to sit on cascara (sun-dried exterior fruit of the coffee bean) and cocoa nibs to add depth and complexity. The beer retains the fingerprint of our yeast culture and evolves in your glass, but is a wild departure from our lively bottle-fermented offerings. Be Still is a glimpse into an alternative beer universe that is just waiting to be explored. Due to the nature of this beer (yeast-free), it is recommended that you consume the beer fresh within 6 months of batch date on bottle to avoid oxidation flavors from shrouding your experience.	9.0	\N	S0o5OV	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:59.159061-06

Beach Bear is light bodied, crisp, slightly sweet, and a little fruity from the whole cone American hops added late in the boil and after fermentation. Cascade and Green magic combine to provide a grassy, grapefruit, orange, lychee, and kiwi hop flavor that melds nicely with a primarily pilsner based beer. Our house yeast provides a lager like drinkability to this ale that makes it a quaffable option for the hot summer that doesn't lack in flavor!	6.5	31	ZvkADd	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:59.16226-06

3874	ac64caab-5236-43db-92eb-f437d163cfb6	Bay Circut Pale Ale -AMC	Dedicated to the AMC's new hiking trail, this Pale Ale is one that straddles the world’s predominant styles of Pale: English vs. American. The malt profile (and body) is more in line with the English, a succinct toasty/biscuit flavor is apparent from sip one. Both the floral quality and bittering quality of the hops is slightly more assertive, much like the classic American Pale style. The color is that of brightly polished copper, with a smudge of amber to deepen the effect.	\N	\N	wqbOJv	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:59.187433-06

Bayliner Weisse is our take on the traditional German Berliner Weisse style. Over 700 breweries in Germany used to make this beer and by the 19th century it was their most popular style of beer. By the late 20th century only two breweries in Berlin still produce these beers. This particular style is an unfiltered, sour wheat beer that comes in at about 3.6% alc/vol. It is a nice sessionable beer that can be enjoyed anytime of the year. Traditionally served with woodruff or raspberry syrup but it is most enjoyable when served on it's own.	3.6	4	5vM6sS	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:59.1976-06

The first steam Locomotive on the Ludwig Railway was an Adler Locomotive.\r\n\r\nWe’ll see you there, prost!	\N	\N	vJLe6o	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:59.198966-06

Lafitte’s illicit adventures and love of revelry frustrated the authorities and captivated the public’s imagination as he blazed a dashing path of ne’er-do-well exploits along the Gulf Coast. The lawless privateer morphed into a hero when he and his crew took up arms in defense of New Orleans during the War of 1812. Lafitte’s colorful tradition lives on in the unabashedly bold flavor of Bayou Bootlegger.	5.9	\N	R6zVJ7	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:59.200849-06

Strong aromas of orange and honey lead into a flavor that’s soft, sweet, and sophisticated. A dry, herbal finish comes from aging the beer on organic loose green tea, sourced from Somerville's Mem Tea Imports.	8.0	\N	enZQX8	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:59.728623-06

The nose has nice notes of Mesquite wood and brown sugar from the honey, followed nicely by hints of spicy phenols (clove and pepper) from the yeast. The mouthfeel is initially nice and bright, flowing smoothly into a full flavor from both the honey and the yeast, with a slight hint of pepper and lemon from the subtle hops we used. Finishing nice and dry, it is hard to believe this beer clocks in at 8.5%. A nice and easy way to enjoy those perfect AZ days that blend between Winter and Spring.	8.5	52	qgqyWn	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:59.732585-06

3963	93ce6e3a-561a-4a30-a4a7-e614bc2383b9	Beechy Summer Ale	Beechy Summer Ale is a beer that can trace its roots back to our first commercial brew, in the original brewery in Ben’s dads shed back in 2005.  This beer has been really dialled in through tasting our range, reviewing recipes and hop profiles over the past 6 months, but relies on our 13 year brewing and industry experience.\r\n\r\nThis all translates into the beer we have created, an aromatic Australian summer ale with a punchy hop aroma, low pallet weight and a clean drying finish with moderate to low bitterness.\r\n\r\nWhat’s with the Beech?\r\n\r\nBridge Road Brewers is located in Beechworth, at the foot of Victoria’s High Country, about 4hrs drive in any direction from the nearest ocean beach.\r\n\r\nHowever hanging out at the local beach during the peak of summer is something that we love as much any seaside dweller. The High Country is littered with waterways and swimming holes, including the mighty Murray River, beautiful Lake Catani on Mt Buffalo and our own spring fed lake in heart of Beechworth, Lake Sambell. We’re really looking forward to Summer evenings at the lake this year with this beer in hand.	4.4	\N	w2QX9N	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:59.737914-06

For our version of the classic American Wheat, we use less two-row and more Munich malt for depth, and soften the edges with the lightness of wheat. Local Black Forest honey adds character without sweetness.	4.1	16	6GLiDO	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:59.739713-06

3967	0c454a1a-d2ba-42d7-80c0-5637d66d406d	BeeJezus Belgian Gruit	Long before “hops” were the norm for “spicing” beers, brewers used a wide variety of botanicals for enhancing the flavor of their stew pot concoctions. The botanicals or herbs we used in this beer cannot be more “local” due to the fact that we grow 2 out of 3 of them! We grow and spice this Belgian Pale Ale with our own Bee Balm, Lemon Balm and locally source Jasmine Green Tea. The beer has absolutely no hops and the herbs compliment the spicy Belgian yeast on their own. The result is a refreshingly subdued citrus and pepper flavor that melds nicely with this style of beer.	8.0	\N	nnlomE	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:59.741274-06

The beer features special ingredients such as malt smoked over manuka wood (a tree native to New Zealand) and manuka honey. Additionally it contains beechwood honey from California and Tahitian vanilla beans to reflect the sweet and roasted notes we were looking for in this collaboration.	7.7	32	BdlH6M	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:59.755719-06

The complex fruity nature of Duvel's signature yeast is the first thing that greets you, followed shortly but a blast of bright, citrusy hops. The beer also has a touch of lemon peel for a po that greets the palate right at the finish of this deceptively drinkable and complex beer.	8.0	35	QHCtPE	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:59.756401-06
3988	cfcd48cb-a239-4c12-bc8a-81bed68b19eb	Beer Camp: Dry-Hopped Barleywine-Style Ale	We're brewing a Dry-Hopped Barleywine Style Ale. Avery's founder, Adam Avery, was eager to brew this style and us this story: Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Barleywine inspired him to try his hand at the style, leading to the creation of Hog Heaven, an Avery brewing classic. The idea behind this beer for Beer Camp Across the World is actually not to "collaborate" at all, but, rather, to brew the exact recipe for Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot and the exact recipe of for Avery's Hog Heaven and blend the two distinct finished beers together, and then bottle condition a new version of these two classic beers. The resulting brew is lovingly dubbed "Big Hog" or "HogFoot" depending on the brewer's preference. It's big, intense, and hoppy. Great fresh or the perfect candidate for aging down the line.	9.4	90	nxU5Fn	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:59.757114-06
3989	206726f5-6948-4cf7-9cbc-7681caae8171	Beer Camp: Dry-Hopped Berliner-Style Weisse	We wanted to make a beer that was a bit outside of both breweries' normal wheelhouses, so together we chose to create a twist on the classic, tart, Berliner Weisse. We're playing off the slightly sour twang of the base beer by adding heaps of dry-hopped flavor to complement the tartness with citrusy and fruit-forward hop notes. The primary yeast strain is Sierra Nevada's famous Kellerweis wheat beer yeast, which imparts notes of banana and clove, blending seamlessly with the hops to create a dry, white-wine-like flavor that is as crisp and refreshing as anything we've tried.	4.2	10	2avhYf	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:59.757833-06
3990	fdcf77c0-27ad-4fa5-a47f-9680d37624cc	Beer Camp: Dunkle Weisse	We are brewing a classic Bavarian-Style Dunkle Weisse (Dark Wheat) beer. Ayinger's wheat beers are among the best produced anywhere in the world. We decided to bring together our two approaches to the style and create an all-new, rich, and malty version of the style. It's brewed in our open fermenter to allow the authentic Bavarian yeast strain to shine, with complex aromas of banana bread, caramel malt and cloves.	5.7	10	eueVi6	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:59.758638-06

Sierra Nevada's malt body and profile was blended with the heavy-handed, very late hopping schedule employed by Tree House to create a new, hybrid IPA. Lightly bitter and heavy with citrus-like hop flavor.	7.0	40	z8iAm9	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:59.759375-06
3992	3387714c-0833-4729-a621-6c7a6d5f8d90	Beer Camp: Ginger Lager	Together, we're brewing a lager infused with hot ginger and a touch of cayenne (which emphasizes the ginger heat) before fermenting on a blend of oak honeycombs and hops. This may seem like an odd concept -and let's be honest, it IS an odd concept- but the finished beer more than makes up for the seemingly strange combination of flavors. The ginger is bright and crisp, the cayenne falls just below the heat threshold, and the oak adds a delicate roundness to the finish. This ultra-crisp lager is very balanced and incredibly drinkable and will be on of the sleeper hits of the Beer Camp pack.	6.2	20	bSQyva	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:59.76009-06

This beer features raspberry, cocoa and vanilla, in addition to lactose (an unfermentable sugar) that adds a richness and a sweetness, helping to blend and meld the flavors of this ultra-complex beer together. It's been a true pleasure to work with the artists at The Bruery using ingredients and techniques outside of our normal wheelhouse.	8.0	10	q5sbES	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:48:59.760791-06

4008	6a8f1501-a911-40b8-b343-60aa69af6bd1	BEHIND ABBEY DOORS	We want to know how those Belgian monks really do it, but the brew house doors at the monasteries seem to always be locked a little too tightly. What are they doing back there? Is there one super monk that does all the brewing while the other monks text their monastery bros? Do they turn water into wine, then turn wine into beer? Are they doing something...um, weird...? Who knows? They're probably just really good at brewing. Anyways, we took a lightly sweetened version of a brown ale and fermented it with Belgian yeast. A touch of toast and a light bitterness leaves a divine result.	6.4	25	IwKBkF	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:49:00.459444-06

4012	6359782f-4136-485a-89fe-599aa5326ef9	Bel Dorado, B.S. IPA	A Belgian Style IPA, based on our Half Cycle IPA.  Same huge hop presence as Half Cycle, but with a slightly fruity, drier finish than its American cousin.  Generously dry-hopped with El Dorado hops which give it an extra layer of complexity.	\N	\N	yZF0nm	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:49:00.463207-06

The result? Strange Bel'Hop'D Belgian Pale Ale–on the dark side with moderate fruity orange hues and soft, sip-able sweetness.	5.0	40	w58rCQ	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:49:00.46413-06

4015	db2e550a-3182-4f61-8e57-20b547b67f15	Bela	Bela may sound like a sweet name, but she's actually quite bitter.  A beer style that does not technically exist, the addition of over 25 pounds of Czech Saaz hops in this small-batch beer results in high hop bitterness and quite obvious Noble hop aroma and flavor. It is also a high alcohol beer with a nice warming effect, medium-body and some malty residual sweetness to remind you that Bela might still have a sweet side after all.	10.2	85	iOpksg	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:49:00.466014-06

Incredibly refreshing and drinkable. Tribute to the ship in Life Aquatic. We love Bill Murray. Here he is looking into our grundy tank (not really).	5.7	\N	GuMZid	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:49:00.467044-06

A slight boozy nose followed by a sweet, velvety and palatable finish similar to a port or sherry.  As the name implies, Elrond would be drinking this.	\N	\N	ObUYor	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:49:00.470626-06

4022	8153014e-7462-49c8-a149-50ada97c6c71	Belfast Black	This is the beer that started the brewery. Named after the ancient homeland of the Lavery's. It is rich, dark and smokey. Not for the faint of heart but that's how we intended it. It has a taste of bacon, which is one of the most beautiful images I can image; a bacon beer (No actual bacon is in this beer). A solid earthy hop bitterness with a little astringency from the dark malts. This beer has no better pair than excellent Vermont Cheddar cheese.	7.0	35	qxOfzM	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:49:00.472278-06

Sitting on a beach trying to catch stripers will be easy because you will already have one in your hand.\r\n Sense experience: A crisp refreshing light brew with citrus, spice and Belgian yeast overtones.	4.7	\N	y2HK0K	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:49:00.476855-06

This deep purple beer is textured with sweet notes of caramelized malts, spicy rye, oak, juicy berries and a pleasantly sour funk. It’s a rather befuddling meld of flavors with an outcome that we couldn’t enjoy more.	10.6	\N	iazWV1	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:49:00.589614-06

4135	b4700694-e56b-4803-a3e0-cf323d856c0e	Belgian Wit	Belgian Wits originated in Belgium, in the area of Brabant just east of Brussels. This are was a part of the Netherlands in the early 1800's and was the wheat growing region. In this era, the Dutch basically controlled the spice trade, thus, coriander as well as Curacao orange peel made its way into the beer. Spices were used well before the widespread use of hops in beer. At one point there were more than thirty breweries producing a Wit, but overtime the style died off and in 1954 the last of the breweries ceased operations. One of the most famous brands of Belgian Wits is Hoegaarden (pronounced \\Who Garden") produced by Pierre Celis back in 1966.

Incredibly sweet, with a lot of maltiness, and some “pure” sweetness added by the Belgian Candi Sugar we add to the boil. A big beer, the overall impression is of a large-bodied, sweet, robust ale. Look for it around Christmas, or our birthday weekend (Columbus Day).	8.9	\N	El33bm	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:49:51.651738-06

4165	f456acc4-e5ff-4ca6-a9c9-98629b8c5524	Belgian Tripel	If you like big complex beers, look no further.  Our Tripel is brewed using a simple malt bill and only a few hop additions.  While the malt and hops do contribute to the final product it's really the yeast that's on display here.  \r\n\r\nWe've had guests tell us they taste hints of raisins, plums, apricots, tangerines, and some spicy notes they can't quite explain.  Neither can we, because we don't add anything other than the basic four  ingredients (water, barley, hops and yeast).  However, due to the strain of yeast and the fermentation process, it produces all these wonderful flavors.  \r\n\r\nBe careful, many have been lured in by her delicate lacing, sweet aromas and intricate flavors only to realize she's a big 9% beer that will sneak up on you if you over indulge.  Don't worry, that's what our lodging is for.  Enjoy!	9.0	34	O5mY7i	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:49:51.668089-06

When Napoleon’s troops occupied Germany, they called them “Champagne of The North,” but some Germans call them the workers’ sparkling wine. This beer is the perfect refresher for a warm summer day.\r\n\r\nWe used 50% wheat and 50% barley to make this beer. The sourness comes from a partial fermentation with lactobacillus bacteria. We then finish fermentation with our house ale yeast. You can expect a lemony aroma and tartness from this beer and a touch of wheatiness in the background. It truly is sparkling lemonade. It is unfiltered, so it will be slightly cloudy.	3.9	7	GA79KD	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:49:51.769709-06

Bright, dry, and refreshing, our Berliner Weisse has a strikingly tart start and prickly finish. Straw-like color and natural haze due to an abundance of wheat intensifies the rustic feel of this beer. Tart citrus notes explode on your palate, while the dry finish leaves you wanting more.	3.3	2	hgfryJ	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:49:51.77448-06

This beer’s tart flavor comes from inoculating the wort with lactobacillus in the kettle and letting it sour before pasteurizing and transferring it for fermentation. Once described as the “Champagne of the North,” we wanted to put our spin on this reemerging style and give you a beer that is light and refreshing with the perfect sour kick!

Our own take on a traditional german classic beer.  Available either with or without “mitt schuss”  A flavor shot added to the beer to cut some of the sourness with some sweetness.	4.3	5	pi1Z3s	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:49:51.790551-06
4227	f715a65f-ae7e-4d67-85f7-40f89133ec32	Berliner Weisse	Berliner Weisse is a top-fermented, bottle conditioned wheat beer made with both traditional warm-fermenting yeasts and lactobacillus culture. They have a rapidly vanishing head and a clear, pale golden straw-coloured appearance. The taste is refreshing, tart, sour and acidic, with a lemony-citric fruit sharpness and almost no hop bitterness. \r\n\r\nServed in wide bulbous stemmed glasses, tourists in Berlin will often order on as a "Berliner Weisse mit Schuss: Himbeere" or "Berliner Weisse mit Schuss: Waldmeister". These are syrups that are added to make the sourness more palatable. Himbeere is raspberry (red) and Waldmeister is woodruff (green).	2.5	6	RVKKEP	brewerydb	2018-03-11 01:49:51.791437-06

This strong, malt-forward brew smells of caramel apples, has a surprisingly light body, and has the flavor of freshly cut melon along with some toffee.	8.4	30	q4ToLY	brewerydb	2018-03-11 11:04:03.072161-05

An amalgam of styles, we like to call it a Belgian-Black-Triple-Rye-India-Pale-Ale. Candied orange and minty hops come through in the nose, with a hint of warm spice and caraway. The flavor is toffee-like malt with a touch of roast, and a medium bitterness to play off of the fresh-baked rye bread peppery notes. The long caramel finish turns dry with just a hint of heat.	10.2	\N	NmtlxR	brewerydb	2018-03-11 11:04:03.129113-05

It is a mildly hoppy pale ale using a 2 row pale base malt and several other specialty malts for body, color, and head retention. It is hopped with American west coast hops throughout the boil giving it a nice hop bite and mild aroma. This one is a bit stronger than the usual pale ale coincidently weighing in at 6.33 alcohol by volume!	6.3	25	ZsQEJt	brewerydb	2018-03-11 11:04:03.59662-05

European hop varieties are traditionally used in this style of beer, however, we elected to stick with the good ole USA grown hops using a good dose of Simcoe, Amarillo, Centennial and Citra hops.

That’s why we want to pay homage to the hard working fish mongers down on Baldwin Street. This IPA is big, assertive and full of attitude…not too unlike the surly characters slicing and dicing today’s catch. A wonderfully floral, piney and mildly citrus nose comes by way of an excessive dose of American hops and British ale yeast. A big malt bill helps achieve a sweet caramel body to compliment a pleasantly balanced hop bite. FishEYE works beautifully with a burger, spicy Indian food and sharp, strong cheese.	6.5	65	5SSxdj	brewerydb	2018-03-11 11:20:34.706173-05

4311	aff1665a-981b-46ff-8669-5824b8d044e3	Banryu Ichi	here is an old saying in Japan, “There are ten thousand ways to make sake.”\r\nCBC is very proud to introduce number ten thousand and one.\r\nBanryu Ichi (10,001 ways in Japanese) is an experimental brew that straddles the line between beer and sake. Produced in collaboration with our good friend and masterful sake home-brewer, Todd Bellomy, this has been one of the most interesting and labor-intensive beers ever to come out of CBC.\r\nWe began last December by spending many cold, windy days in the alley behind the brewery, steaming rice in small batches to brew what became almost fifty gallons of pure sake. Sake is produced by multiple parallel fermentation: polished rice is converted to sugar by a fungus called Koji (Aspergillus oryzae) and fermentation is taken care of by sake yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae kyokai). After several weeks of fermentation this batch of sake (possibly the largest batch of sake ever made in New England) was destined to become the starter for our beer.\r\nJust after Christmas, Todd joined us again to brew a mere six barrels of the craziest beer wort ever. Pale barley malt and flaked rice went into the mash, and after extracting only the first runnings we added a significant amount of brown rice syrup. This yielded a wort of 31*P/1.124SG, or in other words, some really thick, sticky stuff! The wort was sent to the fermenter and then, with fingers crossed, we pumped over the entire batch of sake including the yeast, Koji, and lots of rice slurry. Fermentation was slow and low at 50*F for six weeks, followed by cold-conditioning until it reached more than 15%abv!\r\nIncredibly complex aromas and flavors abound, including sweet rice, fresh apples and grapes, hints of earth and mushroom from the koji, and as it warms further notes of fennel, herbs, and an almost Belgian-yeast spiciness. Brilliant copper-colored, it is full in body despite its very dry finish. This is one to be sipped, savored, and contemplated. Banryu Ichi is a truly unique beverage, served with intentionally very low carbonation in a 5oz. glass set inside a Masu, a traditional cedar sake cup.\r\nKampai!	15.0	\N	0AU9pA	brewerydb	2018-03-11 11:20:38.427178-05

Pop the top and you'll meet its Badass attitude. An attitude that embodies the never quit swagger of Detroiters that stretches across the nation and back. This Detroit made beer doesn't just share Kid Rock's home state roots, it casts the same kind of net that his music does: far, wide and all-out original.\r\n\r\nIt's born out of bushels of American barley and hops harvested straight from the Heartland. It's crafted with care in a place where factories mark one horizon and wild forest mark the next. This beer's built with American pride. Pry one open and you'll know: there's trouble brewing. This is pure American Badass.	4.2	\N	6HTgC1	brewerydb	2018-03-11 11:20:39.130858-05

It’s native to eastern North America and grows right up the street from us at Jorgensen’s Organic farm in Westerville. The firecracker-red flowers are added to our central Ohio wildflower honey with tons of blueberries from Mansfield, Ohio. The result is a balance of berry and tea flavors with a barely sweet finish. If you can stop drinking it long enough to eat… try light, creamy cheeses or along side a fresh lemon sorbet.	13.0	\N	m73LJD	brewerydb	2018-03-11 11:22:50.739298-05

Despite its strength, Bergbock is pleasantly mouthcoating, with a powerful, but unobtrusive body. A highly discrete, finely bitter hoppiness transforms into a slight honey sweetness to conclude on a soft, harmonious aftertaste.\r\n\r\nA harmonious light bock of character that cannot be put down after the first drink.	7.0	\N	ceEcjf	brewerydb	2018-03-11 11:22:50.745227-05
